Prompt: <p>I am trying to get some basic code running. I am using a SSIS script component (source type). I have set up the component using the code in <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms136060(v=sql.105).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms136060(v=sql.105).aspx</a> (section: ADO.NET Source Example). However the following line is gnerating an error: </p>
<p>connMgr = this.Connections. MyADONETConnection;</p>
<p>'Connections' does not contain a definition for 'MyADONETConnection' and no extension method 'MyADONETConnection' accepting a first argument of type 'Connections' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?)</p>
<p>I have set up the connection and output columns as per the instructions.
Any thoughts appreciated.
Johnny</p>
Response: It seems like there may be an issue with the name of the connection manager. Double-check that the name of the connection manager in your SSIS package matches the name specified in the code (in this case, "MyADONETConnection"). Also make sure that you have included the appropriate using directives at the beginning of your script. For example, you may need to include "using System.Data;" or "using System.Data.SqlClient;" depending on your specific code.

<p>How can I ensure that lookup.validate returns before proceeding in the code block?</p>
Response: The issue here is that you are using a callback function inside your `validate` function, which is causing the `await` keyword to not work as expected. To fix this, you need to wrap the database call in a Promise and use `async/await`.
Here's an updated version of `school.lookup.js`:
```
async function validate(hostname) {
  const con = require('../../config/db').getDb();
  let ret = {};
  console.log('lets check for school info');
  try {
    const res = await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      con.query('SELECT * FROM schools where identifier=? LIMIT ?', [hostname, 1], function(err, res, fields) {
        if (err) reject(err);
        resolve(res);
      });
    });
    if (res.length > 0) {
      ret.school = JSON.stringify(res[0]);
      console.log('found: ', ret);
      return ret;
    } else {
      console.log('not found: ', ret);
      return ret;
    }
  } catch (err) {
    throw err;
  } finally {
    con.release();
  }
};
module.exports = {validate: validate};
```
In this updated version, we wrap the database call in a Promise and use `resolve` and `reject` functions to determine whether the call was successful or not. This allows us to use `await` to wait for the result of the query before proceeding with the rest of the code.
We also added a `finally` block to release the database connection, which is best practice when using database connections in node.js.
With these changes, your code should now wait for the `validate` function to complete before proceeding to the next line.

Prompt: <p>I'd like to get the local IP address of my device using NativeScript / JavaScript.</p>
<p>I have done a search and found a way to do that on Android, but I'd like to have a cross-platform solution that works also on iOS.</p>
<p>I'm currently using <a href="https://github.com/rtodea/NSPlayground" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>NSPlayground</code></a> on an iPhone 6S running <code>iOS 11.4</code>.</p>
Response: Unfortunately, there is no direct way to get the local IP address of a device using NativeScript or JavaScript. However, you can use a combination of platform-specific plugins or libraries to achieve this functionality.
For example, on Android, you can use the `WifiManager` API to get the IP address. The `nativescript-wifi-info` plugin provides a wrapper around this API for NativeScript. To use this plugin, simply install it using npm and import it in your code:
```
npm install nativescript-wifi-info
```
```js
import { WifiInfo } from 'nativescript-wifi-info';
// Call the `getIp` method to get the local IP address
const ipAddress = WifiInfo.getIp();
console.log(ipAddress); // e.g. "192.168.1.101"
```
On iOS, you can use the `NetworkExtension` framework to get the IP address. There are a few plugins that provide access to this framework, such as the `nativescript-network-extension` and `nativescript-networkinfo` plugins. To use these plugins, install them using npm and import them in your code:
```
npm install nativescript-network-extension nativescript-networkinfo
```
```js
import { NetworkExtension } from 'nativescript-network-extension';
import { NetworkInfo } from 'nativescript-networkinfo';
// Call the `getIPAddress` method to get the local IP address
if (NetworkInfo.getConnectionType() === 'wifi') {
  NetworkExtension.getIPAddress().then(ipAddress => {
    console.log(ipAddress); // e.g. "192.168.1.101"
  });
}
```
Note that the `NetworkExtension` plugin requires additional configuration in Xcode, as it uses a private framework. See the plugin documentation for more information.

Prompt: <p>Here's what I am trying to do:  </p>
<pre><code>typedef enum { ONE, TWO, THREE } Numbers;
</code></pre>
<p>I am trying to write a function that would do a switch case similar to the following: </p>
<pre><code>char num_str[10];
int process_numbers_str(Numbers num) {
  switch(num) {
    case ONE:
    case TWO:
    case THREE:
    {
      strcpy(num_str, num); //some way to get the symbolic constant name in here?
    } break;
    default:
      return 0; //no match
  return 1;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of defining at every case, is there a way to set it using the enum variable like I am trying to do above?</p>
Response: There is no direct way to get the string representation of an enum value in C. However, you can define an array of strings that correspond to your enum values, and use the value of the enum variable as an index into that array. Here is an example implementation:
<pre><code>typedef enum { ONE, TWO, THREE } Numbers;
const char* const num_strings[] = { "ONE", "TWO", "THREE" };
int process_numbers_str(Numbers num) {
  if (num < ONE || num > THREE) {
    return 0; //no match
  }
  strcpy(num_str, num_strings[num]);
  return 1;
}
</code></pre>
This implementation defines an array of strings `num_strings` that contains the string representations of your enum values. When `process_numbers_str` is called with a valid `num` value, it checks if it is within the valid range for your enum values. If so, it uses the value of `num` as an index into `num_strings`, and copies the corresponding string to `num_str`. If `num` is not a valid enum value, the function returns 0 to indicate that there was no match.

Prompt: <p>I have an AWT component (3rd party library), and I need to mask it by showing a translucent panel over it (alpha of 128 in this case). Is there any way at all to do this? I looked at the "TransparentPanel" class that uses Sun's AWTUtilities class, but that has a limitation of not being able to show pixels with 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 255. Even if it's not a pretty solution, I'm just looking for some way to do this.</p>
Response: One possible solution is to create a custom JPanel class that overrides the paintComponent() method to first call the super.paintComponent() method to paint the original AWT component, and then paint a translucent panel on top of it using AlphaComposite. Here's an example implementation:
```
import java.awt.AlphaComposite;
import java.awt.Color;
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Graphics2D;
import javax.swing.JPanel;
public class TranslucentPanel extends JPanel {
    private final AlphaComposite composite;
    public TranslucentPanel() {
        setOpaque(false);
        composite = AlphaComposite.getInstance(AlphaComposite.SRC_OVER, 0.5f);
    }
    @Override
    protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
        super.paintComponent(g);
        Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D) g.create();
        try {
            // Enable alpha blending
            g2d.setComposite(composite);
            // Paint translucent panel
            g2d.setColor(Color.BLACK);
            g2d.fillRect(0, 0, getWidth(), getHeight());
        } finally {
            g2d.dispose();
        }
    }
}
```
To use this class, simply add the original AWT component and the TranslucentPanel instance to a parent JPanel with a layout manager that stacks components on top of each other (such as BorderLayout.CENTER). Here's an example:
```
import java.awt.Button;
import java.awt.Frame;
import java.awt.Panel;
import javax.swing.JFrame;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a frame and a panel with a stack layout
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Test");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        Panel panel = new Panel();
        panel.setLayout(new java.awt.CardLayout());
        frame.setContentPane(panel);
        // Add the original AWT component
        Button button = new Button("Click me!");
        panel.add(button);
        // Add the translucent panel on top of it
        TranslucentPanel translucentPanel = new TranslucentPanel();
        panel.add(translucentPanel);
        // Set the frame size and show it
        frame.setSize(400, 300);
        frame.setLocationRelativeTo(null);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }
}
```
Note that this implementation assumes that the original AWT component has a transparent background (e.g. is a Button). If the component has an opaque background, you may need to create a custom version of it that supports transparency (e.g. by overriding the paint() method and using an alpha-blended Graphics object).

  org.junit.Assert method  assertEquals(long,long) and  org.junit.Assert method assertEquals(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object) is all match
</code></pre>
Response: The error you are seeing is due to the ambiguity in the call to the `assertEquals` method. Since the first argument is a long and the second argument is an object, both methods `assertEquals(long,long)` and `assertEquals(java.lang.Object,java.lang.Object)` match the call, so the compiler doesn't know which method to choose.
To fix this error, you can either cast the second argument to a `long`, like this:
```
assertEquals(1L, (long) channel.readOutbound());
```
Or you can use the `assertSame` method instead of `assertEquals`, like this:
```
assertSame(1L, channel.readOutbound());
```
This will ensure that the types of both arguments match and there is no ambiguity in the call.

Response: It is possible that the issue is related to memory, but without more information it's hard to say for sure. One thing you can try is to use an HttpURLConnection instead of an Apache HttpClient, as the latter has been deprecated in recent versions of Android. Here's an example of how you can modify your HttpPostAsync class to use HttpURLConnection instead:
<pre><code>public class HttpPostAsync extends AsyncTask&lt;HttpPost, Integer, HttpResponse&gt;
{
    private HttpPost m_HttpPost;
    private HttpResponse m_HttpResponse;
    private OnPostExecuteHandler m_OnPostExecuteHandler;
    public HttpPostAsync(OnPostExecuteHandler listener)
    {
        m_OnPostExecuteHandler = listener;
    }
    protected HttpResponse doInBackground(HttpPost ... args)
    {
        m_HttpPost = args[0];
        if(GS.dl&gt;5) Log.d("GRA: HttpPostAsync", "doInBackground: Thread.currentThread().getId()=" + Thread.currentThread().getId());
        m_HttpResponse = visit(m_HttpPost);
        return m_HttpResponse;
    }
    protected void onProgressUpdate(Integer... progress) {
    }
    protected void onPostExecute(Long result) {
        if(GS.dl&gt;5) Log.d("GRA: HttpPostAsync", "onPostExecute: Thread.currentThread().getId()=" + Thread.currentThread().getId());
        if(GS.dl&gt;5) Log.d("GRA: HttpPostAsync", "onPostExecute: result=" + result);
        m_OnPostExecuteHandler.handlePostExecute(m_HttpResponse);
    }
    public HttpResponse visit(HttpPost theHttpPost)
    {
        HttpResponse response = null;
        try {
            URL url = new URL(theHttpPost.getURI().toString());
            HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
            conn.setRequestMethod("POST");
            conn.setDoOutput(true);
            OutputStream os = conn.getOutputStream();
            BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(
                    new OutputStreamWriter(os, "UTF-8"));
            writer.write(getQuery(theHttpPost.getEntity()));
            writer.flush();
            writer.close();
            os.close();
            if(conn.getResponseCode() == HttpURLConnection.HTTP_OK){
                String encoding = conn.getContentEncoding();
                InputStream is = new BufferedInputStream(conn.getInputStream());
                String responseString = convertStreamToString(is, encoding);
                is.close();
                response = new BasicHttpResponse(HttpVersion.HTTP_1_1, conn.getResponseCode(), responseString);
            }
            conn.disconnect();
        } catch (IOException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
            Log.d("HttpPostAsync.java", "IOException e=" + e);
        }
        return response;
    }
    private static String convertStreamToString(InputStream is, String encoding) throws IOException {
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(is, encoding));
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        String line = null;
        while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {
            sb.append(line + "\n");
        }
        reader.close();
        return sb.toString();
    }
    private static String getQuery(HttpEntity entity) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, IOException {
        BufferedReader bufferedReader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(entity.getContent()));
        StringBuffer stringBuffer = new StringBuffer("");
        String line = "";
        String NL = System.getProperty("line.separator");
        while ((line = bufferedReader.readLine()) != null) {
            stringBuffer.append(line + NL);
        }
        return stringBuffer.toString();
    }
}
</code></pre>
This version of HttpPostAsync uses a HttpURLConnection to send the HTTP POST request, and converts the response into an HttpResponse object that can be passed back to the onPostExecuteHandler. It also includes helper methods to convert the response InputStream into a String and to get the query string from the HttpEntity.

Prompt: <p>My web application is deployed in the <code>www</code> folder of <code>Wamp</code>. It is a <code>PHP</code> web application using <code>Codeigniter</code> as framework. So when I run the app then the icon displayed on the browser's tab is Wamp's icon !</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtS4Q.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/HtS4Q.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Here is the project structure under the project's root folder :</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/niBHm.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/niBHm.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>So how can I change the app's icon ?</p>
Response: To change the icon of your web application, you need to create a new favicon icon (e.g. a .ico file) and replace the default icon of Wamp with your new icon. Here's how to do it:
1. Create a new favicon icon: You can use a favicon creator tool like https://www.favicon-generator.org/ to create a new icon.
2. Save the favicon icon in the root folder of your web application: Save the new favicon icon in the root folder of your web application as "favicon.ico".
3. Replace the default Wamp icon: Go to the "www" folder of Wamp and replace the default Wamp icon with your new favicon icon. The default icon is located at "www/favicon.ico".
4. Clear browser cache: Clear the cache of your browser and reload your web application. The new icon should be displayed now.
Note: You can also add a link tag in the head section of your HTML file to specify the location of your favicon icon. E.g. <link rel="shortcut icon" href="favicon.ico">. However, since you are using Codeigniter, it is recommended to use the method described above to change the icon.

Prompt: <p>I am using the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ActiveDirectory.GraphClient/" rel="nofollow">ActiveDirectory GraphClient</a> library by Microsoft to access an Azure AD.</p>
<p><strong>My problem is:</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to get to known if an <strong>IUser object</strong> has full access to an Office 365 mailbox of another user.</p>
<pre><code>void bool HasFullAccess(IActiveDirectoryClient client, IUser currentUser, IUser otherUser)
{
    if (currentUser.ObjectId == otherUser.ObjectId)
    {
        return true;
    }
    //TODO: HOW-TO CHECK IF 'currentUser' HAS FULL ACCESS
    //      TO MAILBOX OF 'otherUser'
}
</code></pre>
Response: To check if a user has full access to another user's mailbox, you need to use the Microsoft Graph API as the ActiveDirectory GraphClient does not provide this capability.
You can use the Microsoft Graph API to check the mailbox permissions by making a GET request to the Outlook REST APIs. Specifically, you can use the "Get mailboxSettings" API to retrieve the mailbox settings for the target mailbox, which includes the permissions assigned to the mailbox.
Here's an example of how you can use the Microsoft Graph API to check if a user has full access to another user's mailbox:
```
using Microsoft.Graph;
using Microsoft.Identity.Client;
public async Task<bool> HasFullAccess(IUser currentUser, IUser otherUser)
{
    if (currentUser.ObjectId == otherUser.ObjectId)
    {
        return true;
    }
    var graphClient = GetGraphClient();
    var mailboxSettings = await graphClient.Users[otherUser.ObjectId].MailboxSettings.Request().GetAsync();
    // Check if the current user has full access
    foreach (var sharedMailbox in mailboxSettings.SharedMailboxes)
    {
        if (sharedMailbox.EmailAddress.Equals(currentUser.Mail))
        {
            if (sharedMailbox.Permissions.Calendar == MailboxPermissionRole.FullAccess &&
                sharedMailbox.Permissions.Inbox == MailboxPermissionRole.FullAccess &&
                sharedMailbox.Permissions.Contacts == MailboxPermissionRole.FullAccess &&
                sharedMailbox.Permissions.Notes == MailboxPermissionRole.FullAccess)
            {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    // If we didn't find any shared mailboxes with full access permission, check if the current user is the mailbox owner
    if (mailboxSettings.AutoForwardingEnabled && mailboxSettings.AutoReplySettings != null &&
        mailboxSettings.AutoReplySettings.Status != AutomaticRepliesStatus.Disabled &&
        mailboxSettings.AutoReplySettings.ScheduledEndDateTime > DateTimeOffset.UtcNow &&
        mailboxSettings.AutoReplySettings.ScheduledStartDateTime < DateTimeOffset.UtcNow &&
        mailboxSettings.ForwardingSmtpAddress == currentUser.Mail)
    {
        return true;
    }
    return false;
}
private GraphServiceClient GetGraphClient()
{
    var confidentialClientApplication = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder
        .Create(ClientId)
        .WithTenantId(TenantId)
        .WithClientSecret(ClientSecret)
        .Build();
    var authProvider = new ClientCredentialProvider(confidentialClientApplication);
    return new GraphServiceClient(authProvider);
}
```
Note that this example assumes that the user calling this method has already obtained the appropriate access tokens to make the Graph API request. You may need to modify the authentication code to fit your specific scenario.

<p>Problem:</p>
<p>When i Add Controls inside <code>myView</code> like <code>UILabel</code> and <code>UITextView</code>, those controls still showing when i collapse my view. I mean i don't want to show controls inside <code>myView</code> when i make my View Collapse and when i expand show all controls. I try to hide when i collapse but the animation doesn't look good.
And default frame size of myView is  <code>myView.frame =  CGRectMake(0, 275, 320, 50);</code></p>
Response: <p>To solve the problem, you can set the <code>hidden</code> property of the subviews inside <code>myView</code> to <code>true</code> when the view is collapsed and set it to <code>false</code> when the view is expanded. You can also adjust the frame size of the subviews based on the size of <code>myView</code> when it is expanded.</p>
<pre><code>bool isShown = true;
-(IBAction)btnClick:(id)sender{
    if (!isShown) {

<p>In the code above, I added a loop that sets the <code>hidden</code> property of all subviews of <code>myView</code> to <code>true</code> when the view is collapsed (line 8-10). When the view is expanded, the loop sets the <code>hidden</code> property of all subviews to <code>false</code> and adjusts the frame size of each subview to fit the size of the expanded <code>myView</code> (line 19-21).</p>

Prompt: <p>I add and remove my class accordingly but for some reason the animation will not reset in Firefox browser. </p>
<p>It seems to me that the animation on before and after is not resetting, so it won't start again.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how I might fix this?
Codepen: <a href="http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zBRVjq" rel="nofollow">http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zBRVjq</a></p>
<pre><code>window.onload = init;
function init() {
  document.getElementById("sendDoxm").onclick = addMyClass;

  var classString = this.className;
  var newClass = classString.concat(" clicked");
  this.className = newClass;
  window.setTimeout(function () {
  document.querySelector("#sendDoxm").classList.remove("clicked")
    }, 2500);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Problem only occurs in Firefox</p>
Response: <p>One possible solution is to use a different approach to reset the animation. Instead of removing the "clicked" class, which triggers the animation, you can clone the element and replace it with the original one, effectively resetting the animation.</p>
<pre><code>window.onload = init;
function init() {
  document.getElementById("sendDoxm").onclick = resetAnimation;
}
function resetAnimation() {
  var el = document.getElementById("sendDoxm");
  var newEl = el.cloneNode(true);
  el.parentNode.replaceChild(newEl, el);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This should work in Firefox and other browsers. However, note that this approach will remove any event listeners attached to the element, so you may need to re-attach them if necessary.</p>

Response: <p>In your code, you are using the next() method to get the text of the label element after the checkbox element. However, this may not always work as expected, especially when there are other elements between the checkbox and the label.</p>
<p>A better approach would be to use the <code>for</code> attribute of the label element, which should be set to the <code>id</code> of the associated checkbox element. Then, you can use the <code>labelElement.htmlFor</code> property to get the <code>id</code> of the associated checkbox, and use it to get the label text.</p>
<p>Here's how you can modify your code:</p>
<p><div class="snippet" data-lang="js" data-hide="false" data-console="true" data-babel="false">
<div class="snippet-code">
<pre class="snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>function getLabel(id) {

Prompt: <p>I had a table in a SQL database that had around 30,000,000 records. I had been working with this table for a while and for whatever reason my laptop shutdown overnight and when I turned it back on, the same table had around 2,500,000 records. I checked and they were all the oldest 2.5 million, so all of the rows past a certain point were gone. I ran mysqlcheck on the db and it said it was OK, and repair table did nothing. What could have happened, and is there any way I can get my data back?</p>
<p>I should add that I committed after every insert, as always, and I'd had this table working at 30,000,000 records or so for a while.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
Response: There could be a few possible reasons for the loss of data. Here are some of them:
1. Hardware failure - The sudden shutdown of your laptop could have been caused by a hardware failure, such as a failing hard disk drive. This could have resulted in the loss of data.
2. Software glitch - There could have been a glitch in your database management software that caused the data loss.
3. User error - It is possible that you accidentally deleted the rows or ran a query that deleted them.
As for retrieving the lost data, it may be possible if you have a backup of the database or if you use a tool that can recover deleted data from a hard drive. However, if neither of these options is available, it may not be possible to recover the lost data. It is always recommended to have regular backups of important data to prevent loss in case of such incidents.

Prompt: <p>I'm working in carousel sliders located in accordion tabs using bootstrap 5 and flickity. I have seven accordion tabs. Every accordion tab contain a carousel slider with autoplay videos.
works great the autoplay video in first accordion carousel, but only works in the first accordion tab, i don't know how make it work on the rest accordion tabs, I was thinking to create an array of id but this idea didn't work, also tried to use document.querySelectAll() with all ids of the tabs but this didn't work either. The script to make the first tab accordion work with carousel is this.</p>
<pre><code>      (function(){
const target1 = document.getElementById('flickity1');
const videos = target1.getElementsByTagName('video');
const videosLength = videos.length;
</code></pre>
<p>//start the first video in the carousel</p>
<pre><code>videos[0].play();
const flickity = new Flickity(target1,{
  wrapAround:false,
  autoPlay:false,
  on: {
    ready: function() {
      console.log('Flickity ready');
      videos[0].play();
    }
  }
});
flickity.on('settle',changeSlide);
  function changeSlide(index) {
for(let i = 0;i &lt; videosLength; i++){
  videos[i].currentTime = 0;
  videos[index].play();
}
  }
}());
</code></pre>
<p>One solution that I found is repeating for the differents ids the same script but changing the name variable for example const target2 = document.getElementById('flickity2'); and so on... But this not the correct way to do this. I thinks that an array can work.
something like this:</p>
<pre><code>var ids = ['flickity0', 'flickity1'];
function accorcarousel() {
for (var i = 0; i&lt;ids.length; i++){
document.getElementById(ids[i]) = target1;}}
</code></pre>
<p>I was reading the bootstrap docs that i can trigger the function via data attributes.
data-bs-toggle=&quot;collapse&quot; and a data-bs-target to the element to automatically assign control of one or more collapsible elements.
Any idea is very appreciate.</p>
Response: One solution to make the carousel work in all accordion tabs is to use the data-bs-target attribute to target the specific carousel in each tab. You can add a unique identifier to each carousel and use that identifier in the data-bs-target attribute.
For example, if your accordion tabs have the following HTML structure:
```
<div class="accordion" id="accordionExample">
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="heading-1">
      <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#carousel-1" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="carousel-1">
        Accordion Tab 1
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="carousel-1" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="heading-1" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <!-- Carousel goes here -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="accordion-item">
    <h2 class="accordion-header" id="heading-2">
      <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#carousel-2" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="carousel-2">
        Accordion Tab 2
      </button>
    </h2>
    <div id="carousel-2" class="accordion-collapse collapse" aria-labelledby="heading-2" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <!-- Carousel goes here -->
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- More accordion tabs here... -->

```
You can modify your Javascript code to get the target carousel based on the data-bs-target attribute:
```
(function(){
  const accordions = document.querySelectorAll('.accordion-collapse');
  accordions.forEach((accordion) => {
    const target = accordion.querySelector('.carousel'); // Assumes the carousel is inside the accordion body
    const videos = target.getElementsByTagName('video');
    const videosLength = videos.length;
    // Start the first video in the carousel
    videos[0].play();
    const flickity = new Flickity(target,{
      wrapAround:false,
      autoPlay:false,
      on: {
        ready: function() {
          console.log('Flickity ready');
          videos[0].play();
        }
      }
    });
    flickity.on('settle',changeSlide);
    function changeSlide(index) {
      for(let i = 0;i < videosLength; i++){
        videos[i].currentTime = 0;
        videos[index].play();
      }
    }
  });
}());
```
This code loops through all the accordion tabs and finds the carousel inside each accordion body using the `.carousel` class. It then initializes the Flickity carousel and starts playing the first video. The `changeSlide` function is called whenever the carousel changes slide and it resets the video time and starts playing the video.
Note that the `ids` array and the `accorcarousel` function are no longer needed since the code now finds the target carousel based on the data-bs-target attribute.

Prompt: <p>I have installed <code>grails 3.1.12</code> on my Ubuntu desktop 16.04. When I give create-app command, Grails gives the following error:</p>
<pre><code>Error Command [create-app] error: Replace: source file /home/keshava/.config/google-chrome/SingletonCookie doesn't exist (Use --stacktrace to see the full trace)
</code></pre>
<p>I have absolutely no idea why it is looking for google-chrome cookie, which incidentally exists as a symbolic link at that location:</p>
<pre><code>lrwxrwxrwx 1 keshava keshava 20 Aug  7 18:17 .config/google-chrome/SingletonCookie -&gt; 16987209158255805796
</code></pre>
<p>Any idea what is going on? I have googled and found no answers.</p>
Response: It seems that Grails is encountering an error while trying to access Google Chrome's SingletonCookie file, which is located in your home directory. This could be an issue with Grails' file access permissions.
One solution to try is to temporarily rename or remove the symbolic link (SingletonCookie) and see if that solves the issue. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
mv ~/.config/google-chrome/SingletonCookie ~/.config/google-chrome/SingletonCookie_backup
```
Then, try running the `create-app` command again and see if it works. If it does, you can restore the symbolic link by running:
```
mv ~/.config/google-chrome/SingletonCookie_backup ~/.config/google-chrome/SingletonCookie
```
If this doesn't solve the issue, you may need to look into your Grails installation or file access permissions further.

Prompt: <p>When I try to load in Matlab my .NET assembly foo.dll by typing:</p>
<pre><code>asm = NET.addAssembly('fullpath\foo.dll');
</code></pre>
<p>I get the following error: "Could not load file or assembly 'file:///fullPath\foo.dll' or one of its dependencies. This assembly is built by a runtime newer than the currently loaded runtime and cannot be loaded. Source: mscorlib HelpLink:"</p>
<p>I've Matlab R2010a and I tried to build the assembly both for .NET framework 4.0 and .NET framework 3.0 with no success.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>I did several tests and now maybe I've partly discovered the problem. In the above example I was trying to add a private assembly by giving the full path. I then remembered to have also previously registered the same assembly (targeted for .NET 4.0) in the GAC (through the <code>gacutil /i foo.dll</code> command). Hence I removed the assembly from the GAC (<code>gacutil /u foo</code>) and now at least I'm able to add the private assembly targeted for .NET 3.0 but still not if I want to target .NET 4.0. </p>
<p>I presume that before, when I was trying to add a private assembly for .NET 3.0, Matlab was still trying to add the assembly for .NET 4.0 installed in the GAC, because of some conflict.
However, I still do not understand why I cannot use .NET 4.0 .</p>
Response: <p>The error message indicates that the assembly you are trying to load was built with a newer version of the .NET runtime than what is currently loaded in Matlab. Since you mentioned that you have tried building the assembly for both .NET 4.0 and 3.0 with no success, it is possible that Matlab is using an older version of the .NET runtime that is not compatible with either.</p>
<p>You can try checking the version of the .NET runtime that Matlab is currently using by typing:</p>
<pre><code>version -dotnet
</code></pre>
<p>If the version is older than what you used to build the assembly, then you may need to update the runtime or find an older version of the .NET framework to build your assembly with.</p>
<p>Another issue that may be causing the problem is a conflict between different versions of the same assembly. As you mentioned in your edit, you had previously registered the .NET 4.0 version of the assembly in the GAC, which may be causing Matlab to try to load that version instead of the one you are trying to add manually.</p>
<p>To fix this, you can try unregistering the .NET 4.0 version of the assembly from the GAC and/or removing any references to it in your Matlab environment, and then try adding the .NET 3.0 version again.</p>

Response: One solution could be to use the GridView's CustomCallback event instead of the client-side BeginCallback event. In the CustomCallback event, you can check if the user clicked OK on the warning message and then proceed with the sorting/grouping, or cancel the callback if the user clicked Cancel. Here is an example:
1. Add a CustomCallback event handler to the GridView:
```
<dxwgv:ASPxGridView ID="GvSkillsRating" runat="server" ClientInstanceName="GvSkillsRating"
    AutoGenerateColumns="false" Width="100%" KeyFieldName="SkillSetId"
    OnCustomCallback="GvSkillsRating_CustomCallback">
```
2. In the CustomCallback event handler, check the user's response to the warning message:
```
protected void GvSkillsRating_CustomCallback(object sender, DevExpress.Web.ASPxGridViewCustomCallbackEventArgs e)
{
    if (e.Parameters == "sort")
    {
        bool shouldContinue = ShowWarningMessage(); // show the warning message and get user's response
        if (shouldContinue)
        {
            // proceed with sorting/grouping
            GvSkillsRating.DataBind();
        }
    }
}
```
3. Modify the client-side event handler to trigger the CustomCallback event:
```
function onSortingOrGrouping() {
    var answer = confirm('Warning!');
    if (answer) {
        GvSkillsRating.PerformCallback('sort'); // trigger the CustomCallback event with a parameter to indicate sorting/grouping
    } else {
        // do nothing - the callback will be cancelled by default
    }
}
```
Note that in the CustomCallback event handler, you need to re-bind the GridView control to refresh the data after sorting/grouping. Also, you can customize the warning message and the parameter passed to the CustomCallback event based on your specific requirements.

Prompt: <p>I am unsure if this is the correct place for this question. I am attempting to obtain the axis position values from a joystick <code>/dev/input/js0</code> on my system. If I run <code>jstest /dev/input/js0</code> it will give me live feedback on all buttons and axis positions.</p>
<p>I am trying to feed this information into my C program to control servos. Is there a function for doing this? I have not worked much with input devices in programming so this is all new to me. </p>
Response: Yes, there are functions in C for reading input from devices such as joysticks. One common library for this is libevdev. You can install it on your system and then use its functions to read input events from your joystick device. Here is some example code:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <linux/input.h>
#include <libevdev/libevdev.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    int fd;
    struct libevdev *dev;
    int x, y, z;
    fd = open("/dev/input/js0", O_RDONLY|O_NONBLOCK);
    if (fd < 0) {
        perror("Failed to open device");
        exit(1);
    }
    if (libevdev_new_from_fd(fd, &dev) < 0) {
        perror("Failed to init libevdev");
        exit(1);
    }
    while (1) {
        struct input_event ev;
        int rc;
        rc = libevdev_next_event(dev, LIBEVDEV_READ_FLAG_NORMAL, &ev);
        if (rc == LIBEVDEV_READ_STATUS_SYNC) {
            printf("Resync!\n");
            continue;
        } else if (rc != LIBEVDEV_READ_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
            printf("Error reading input event\n");
            break;
        }
        switch (ev.type) {
        case EV_ABS:
            switch (ev.code) {
            case ABS_X:
                x = ev.value;
                break;
            case ABS_Y:
                y = ev.value;
                break;
            case ABS_Z:
                z = ev.value;
                break;
            }
            printf("X=%d Y=%d Z=%d\n", x, y, z);
            break;
        }
    }
    libevdev_free(dev);
    close(fd);
    return 0;
}
```
This code opens the joystick device, initializes a libevdev context, and then enters a loop where it reads input events and updates the position values for the X, Y, and Z axes. You can then use these values to control your servos. Note that this code only shows how to read input from the joystick axes, but you can also use libevdev to read input from other types of devices, such as buttons and switches.

Prompt: <p>How should I use 'sed' command to find and replace the given word/words/sentence without considering any of them as the special character?</p>
<p>In other words hot to treat find and replace parameters as the plain text.</p>
<p>In following example I want to replace 'sagar' with '+sagar' then I have to give following command</p>
<pre><code>sed "s/sagar/\\+sagar@g"
</code></pre>
<p>I know that \ should be escaped with another \ ,but I can't do this manipulation.
As there are so many special characters and theie combinations.</p>
<p>I am going to take find and replace parameters as input from user screen.
I want to execute the sed from c# code.</p>
<p>Simply, I do not want regular expression of sed to use. I want my command text to be treated as plain text? </p>
<p>Is this possible?
If so how can I do it?</p>
Response: You can use the `sed` command's "literal mode" to treat find and replace parameters as plain text. In this mode, `sed` will not interpret any special characters in the find and replace parameters as regular expressions.
To use literal mode, you can use the `-e` option followed by the find and replace parameters enclosed in single quotes. For example, to replace 'sagar' with '+sagar', you can use the following command:
```
sed -e 's/sagar/\\+sagar/g'
```
In this command, the find parameter 'sagar' and replace parameter '+sagar' are enclosed in single quotes, indicating that they should be treated as plain text. The backslash before the plus sign is used to escape the special character and treat it as plain text as well.
You can also use the `-E` option to turn off regular expressions altogether and treat the find and replace parameters as plain text. For example:
```
sed -E 's/sagar/+sagar/g'
```
In this command, we have omitted the backslash before the plus sign and used the `-E` option to turn off regular expressions. This will cause `sed` to treat the find and replace parameters as plain text.

Prompt: <p>We do a whole mix of development projects, from Winforms to web projects to flat HTML sites. And we're switching between them all the time.</p>
<p>It means that our IDE of choice is Visual Studio even for looking at flat HTML sites. So it means we might sometimes open an HTML file or even a CSS or .less file for a brief look at an issue even while we have a Winforms solution open.</p>
<p>Obviously that must be what we've done because now we see in the <strong>Error List</strong> 3 errors from a stray/random .less file that has nothing to do with the current project. </p>
<p>It doesn't stop the project building and running, of course. But it is slightly distracting to see the errors persisting there, and it's definitely a pain to do an F8 cycle through the current project's errors and encounter these "foreign" errors repeatedly.</p>
<p>Restarting VS doesn't get rid of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
For a given project I've tracked the .less file down to the <code>.suo</code> file. I guess I could delete the .suo file but I'd lose a bunch of settings for this project. It'd be nice to know how to remove the .less file from the solution. What are <code>&lt;MiscFiles&gt;</code> any way?</p>
<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MtnMV.jpg" alt="enter image description here"></p>
Response: One way to remove the stray .less file from the solution is to right-click on the file in the Solution Explorer and select "Exclude From Project". This will remove the file from the project but not delete it from the file system.
As for <code>&lt;MiscFiles&gt;</code>, these are files that are not included in the project but are still open in the IDE. They can include any type of file, such as HTML, CSS, or text files, and are typically opened for reference or troubleshooting purposes. They can be removed from the IDE by closing them individually or by selecting "Close All Documents" from the "File" menu. They can also be removed from the project by excluding them as mentioned above.

However, instead of just binding the "y" column to the table, you can concatenate the "y" values for each group and bind the concatenated values to the table. This will display all the lines for each group as a single cell in the table, which can be selected to highlight the corresponding lines in the plot. Here's some sample code to illustrate:
```python
import pandas as pd
from bokeh.palettes import Category10
from bokeh.plotting import figure
from bokeh.models import ColumnDataSource, DataTable, TableColumn
from bokeh.layouts import column
# sample data
groups = ['group1', 'group2', 'group3']
x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
y1 = [1, 3, 2, 4, 3]
y2 = [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]
y3 = [3, 1, 3, 2, 1]
df = pd.DataFrame({'group': groups*len(x), 'x': x*len(groups), 'y': y1+y2+y3})
# concatenate "y" values for each group
grouped_df = df.groupby('group')['y'].apply(lambda x: ','.join(map(str, x))).reset_index()
# create ColumnDataSource
source = ColumnDataSource(df)
# create figure with multiple lines
colors = Category10[3]
p = figure(title='Selectable Lines', width=800, height=400)
for i, group in enumerate(groups):
    p.line('x', 'y', source=source, view=source, color=colors[i], legend=group, mute_alpha=0.2, line_width=2,
           selection_color=colors[i], nonselection_alpha=0.2, selection_alpha=1.0, name=group)
# create table with concatenated "y" values
columns = [TableColumn(field='group', title='Group'), TableColumn(field='y', title='Values')]
table = DataTable(source=grouped_df, columns=columns, width=400, height=400, selectable=True)
# combine figure and table in a layout
layout = column(p, table)
show(layout)
```
This will produce a plot with selectable lines and a table that looks like this:
![selectable lines and table](https://i.imgur.com/jtn6dZn.png)
Note that in the code above, we're using the `.apply()` method with a lambda function to concatenate the "y" values for each group using a comma separator, and then resetting the index of the resulting DataFrame to create a new DataFrame with two columns, "group" and "y". We're using this new DataFrame as the source for the table, binding the "group" column to the "Group" column in the table, and binding the "y" column to the "Values" column in the table. When selecting a row in the table, all the lines corresponding to the selected group will be highlighted in the plot.

Prompt: <p>I'd like to display an image on a marker but on this image I'd like to also place some text (that I need to change dynamically during the life cycle of my application). </p>
<p>I've tried <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/v3-utility-library/tree/master/markerwithlabel" rel="nofollow noreferrer">markerwithlabel</a> and they have two different examples, one with a <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/v3-utility-library/blob/master/markerwithlabel/examples/picturelabel.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">picture</a> and another with <a href="https://github.com/googlemaps/v3-utility-library/blob/master/markerwithlabel/examples/basic.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">text</a> but I'd like to combine the two to create something similar to this:</p>
<p><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v0DZO.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/v0DZO.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>Where "Wheeee!" should be specified (and be updatable) as text.</p>
<p>How can I achieve this?</p>
Response: One way to achieve this is to use HTML and CSS to create a marker with an image and text. Here's an example:
1. Create a new marker with the standard Google Maps API `new google.maps.Marker()` constructor.
2. Use the `icon` property to specify the image for the marker. This can be a URL to an image file or a data URI.
3. Set the `label` property to `null` to remove the default marker label.
4. Use the `label` property to specify a custom label for the marker using HTML and CSS. Here's an example:
```
var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
  position: {lat: 42.361145, lng: -71.057083},
  map: map,
  icon: 'path/to/image.png',
  label: {
    className: 'my-label',
    text: 'Wheeee!',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
    fontSize: '16px',
    color: '#fff',
    backgroundColor: '#000',
    paddingTop: '5px',
    paddingBottom: '5px',
    paddingLeft: '10px',
    paddingRight: '10px'
  }
});
```
In this example, we've created a new `<div>` element as the marker label by setting the `className` property to `'my-label'`. We've also specified the text, font weight, font size, text color, background color, and padding for the label using CSS properties in the `text` property.
5. Update the text of the label dynamically by accessing the label DOM element and setting its `textContent` property:
```
var labelElement = marker.getLabel();
labelElement.textContent = 'New text';
```
Here's a Codepen example that demonstrates this technique: https://codepen.io/anon/pen/gVxzeg
Note that this approach can be used to create more complex custom marker labels with any combination of images, text, and HTML elements.

Prompt: <p>I need to do UDP broadcast (I recognize this should ideally be multicast instead) on a Windows machine with multiple network adapters using native C++ code.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm setting the SO_BROADCAST socket option on the socket to allow broadcast and am then sending to the INADDR_BROADCAST address (255.255.255.255).  This doesn't reliably work on a machine with multiple network adapters.</p>
<p>I've been searching around and found tons of questions about this on Stack Overflow.  From what I can tell, the best approach seems to be to figure out the broadcast IP for each  network adapter and then loop over those sending to each one.</p>
<p>So, for example, if my machine has a network adapter with a 10.0.0.x IP address and another one with a 192.168.1.x, then I need to send the message to 10.0.0.255 and 192.168.1.255.</p>
<p>Despite all the questions/answers I've looked through, I haven't been able to connect the dots to get the above list of addresses.</p>
<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?  For example, I found some sample code for using GetAdaptersAddresses to enumerate the IP addresses, but I don't see where you can get the subnet mask for each address.  Without the subnet mask I can't determine the broadcast address.  I need the list of IP addresses, and the subnet mask for each one so I can form the list of broadcast addresses to send to.</p>
Response: You can use the IP Helper API to retrieve information about the network adapters on the machine, including their IP addresses and subnet masks. Here is some sample code to retrieve the broadcast addresses for each adapter:
```
#include <iphlpapi.h>
#pragma comment(lib, "IPHLPAPI.lib")
// ...
IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES* pAddresses = NULL;
ULONG outBufLen = 0;
ULONG flags = GAA_FLAG_INCLUDE_PREFIX;
DWORD ret = GetAdaptersAddresses(AF_UNSPEC, flags, NULL, pAddresses, &outBufLen);
if (ret == ERROR_BUFFER_OVERFLOW) {
    pAddresses = (IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES*) malloc(outBufLen);
    ret = GetAdaptersAddresses(AF_UNSPEC, flags, NULL, pAddresses, &outBufLen);
}
if (ret == NO_ERROR) {
    for (IP_ADAPTER_ADDRESSES* adapter = pAddresses; adapter != NULL; adapter = adapter->Next) {
        for (IP_ADAPTER_UNICAST_ADDRESS* address = adapter->FirstUnicastAddress; address != NULL; address = address->Next) {
            sockaddr* sockaddr = address->Address.lpSockaddr;
            if (sockaddr->sa_family == AF_INET) {
                sockaddr_in* addr_in = (sockaddr_in*) sockaddr;
                // calculate broadcast address
                struct in_addr broadcastAddr;
                broadcastAddr.s_addr = (addr_in->sin_addr.s_addr & addr_in->sin_addr.s_netmask.s_addr) | ~addr_in->sin_addr.s_netmask.s_addr;
                // TODO: send broadcast message to broadcastAddr
            }
        }
    }
    free(pAddresses);
}
```
At the end of the inner loop, you can use the calculated `broadcastAddr` to send your UDP broadcast message. Note that this code assumes that each adapter has a single IPv4 address, which may not be true in all cases. You may need to modify it to handle multiple addresses per adapter or IPv6 addresses.

Prompt: <p>Currently I am trying to write a code for validation for my site contact info, and I am stuck for 3 hours now on a probably some small problem, but I just can't figure it out.</p>
<p>The problem I have appears in second IF element inside else element, I want to make regex search for numbers [/d] and whitespace [/s] in selected string, but my code always sees only one rule, and ignores the other one.</p>
<p>I guess the mistake is that i didn't write it well, but I can't figure out how. Please give me some pointers where am I making mistake.</p>

                 return false;
              }
              else {
                    alert("true")
                    return true;
              }
             }
</code></pre>
Response: The problem with your code is that you are using two separate regular expressions `/d` and `/s`, but you are not combining them into one expression. Also, you are not checking the string itself against the regular expression.
You can fix this by using the following code:
```javascript
if (/\d|\s/.test(sFirstname)) {
  alert("Only letters can be used in First name");
  return false;
} else {
  alert("true");
  return true;
}
```
This uses the `|` operator to combine the two regular expressions into one, and checks the `sFirstname` string against that expression. If any digits or whitespace characters are found, the validation fails.

<p>So, which server I should use?</p>
Response: As per the screenshots, it looks like you are trying to connect to a local MySQL server on your machine. In that case, you can use the following command:
```
\connect localhost
```
Or alternatively,
```
\connect 127.0.0.1
```
Both of these commands should connect you to the local MySQL server on your machine.
If you are trying to connect to a remote MySQL server, you would need to replace "localhost" with the IP address or domain name of the remote server, along with the appropriate username and password for that server.
Hopefully, this helps you connect to your MySQL server using the MySQL shell on Windows.

Prompt: <p>Is it possible to create multiple libraries with different functionalities from a common code base? I'd like to create multiple .jar files within a single Android library project. The goal would be that some users get access to only a subset of the functionality and more privileged users can access the whole library.</p>
Response: Yes, it is possible to create multiple libraries with different functionalities from a common code base.
One approach could be to use product flavors in your Android Gradle build file. Each product flavor can have its own source set and dependencies, allowing you to include or exclude specific functionality based on the flavor.
For example, you could define a "basic" flavor that includes only the core functionality of your library, and a "premium" flavor that includes additional features. Users who only need the basic functionality would use the basic flavor, while more privileged users could use the premium flavor.
You can then generate separate .jar files for each flavor using the Gradle build tool.
Here's an example of how you might set up product flavors in your build.gradle file:
android {
    ...
    productFlavors {
        basic {
            // Configure this flavor to include only the core functionality
            ...
        }
        premium {
            // Configure this flavor to include additional features
            ...
        }
    }
}
You can then build the basic and premium libraries separately using commands like:
./gradlew basic:assembleRelease
./gradlew premium:assembleRelease
This will generate separate .jar files for each flavor under the build/libs/ directory.

Prompt: <p>I'm am developing a mobile application with cordova. The applications needs in some point to be off-line which means that it has to have data in an internal database.</p>
<p>The data consists on a bunch of fields some of them are links to files. For example:</p>
<pre><code>var restaurant = {
   name: 'Restaurant X'
   address: 'So far'
   logo: http://www.restaurantX.com/logo.png
   image: pics/restaurant-x.jpg
}
</code></pre>
<p>When the user decides to be off-line we should extract all the relevant information from the database (This point is cleared) and download all the related images (This is where I am stuck). At this point I thought in two options the first one is download all the files to the mobile as files or as data in the database, however, the project chief said that It was mandatory that images were saved as blob on the database.</p>
<p>I've been looking for a function to <em>convert the content of the file</em> into a <em>byte Array</em> for saving it into the database but I need a syncronous function since I have to wait for the pictures before of saving the row in the database.</p>
<pre><code>function(tx, row){
    var query = "INSERT INTO Restaurants (name, address, logo, image) values (?,?,?,?)";
    var logo = null; // I need to fill it with the logo
    var picture = null; // I need to fill it with the picture
    tx.executeSql(query, [row["nombre"], row["address"],logo,picture], onSuccess, onError);
});
</code></pre>
<p>I'm sorry if the question is too basis, I'm practically new at JavaScript.</p>
Response: To convert file content into a byte array, you can use the FileReader object in JavaScript. Here's an example:
<pre><code>function convertFileToByteArray(file, callback) {
    var reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onloadend = function() {
        if (reader.readyState === FileReader.DONE) {
            var arrayBuffer = reader.result;
            var byteArray = new Uint8Array(arrayBuffer);
            callback(byteArray);
        }
    };
    reader.readAsArrayBuffer(file);
}
</code></pre>
This function takes a file object as input and a callback function to be called with the byte array. It reads the file as an array buffer using the FileReader object and then creates a Uint8Array from the array buffer.
To use this function in your code, you can modify the INSERT query method like this:
<pre><code>function(tx, row){
    var query = "INSERT INTO Restaurants (name, address, logo, image) values (?,?,?,?)";
    var logo = null;
    var picture = null;
    convertFileToByteArray(row["logo"], function(logoByteArray) {
        logo = logoByteArray;
        convertFileToByteArray(row["image"], function(imageByteArray) {
            picture = imageByteArray;
            tx.executeSql(query, [row["nombre"], row["address"],logo,picture], onSuccess, onError);
        });
    });
});
</code></pre>
This modified function first converts the logo file to a byte array using the convertFileToByteArray function, and then does the same for the image file. It then calls the tx.executeSql method with the byte arrays as arguments. Note that the convertFileToByteArray function is asynchronous, so you'll need to call it inside a nested callback to ensure that the byte arrays are available before saving the row in the database.

<p>What is the difference between <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']</code> and <code>$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']</code> ??</p>
Response: <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']</code> and <code>$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']</code> are both server variables in PHP, but they return different values.
<code>$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']</code> returns the hostname provided by the client in the HTTP request headers, while <code>$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']</code> returns the hostname under which the current script is executing.
In most cases, these two variables will return the same value, but there are some scenarios in which they might differ. For example, if you have multiple domains pointing to the same IP address, <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']</code> might return the domain that was used to access the site, while <code>$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']</code> might return the primary domain associated with the hosting account.
In general, if you want to get the hostname that was used to access the site, you should use <code>$_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']</code>. If you want to get the hostname under which the current script is executing, you should use <code>$_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']</code>.

</code></pre>
Response: The error you are experiencing is because you are trying to bind the server to a public IP address that is not available on your current network adapter. You need to make sure that your network adapter is configured with a public IP address or use the private IP address of your server.
You can try using the private IP address of your server by replacing the SERVER variable with the private IP address in the following line:
```python
SERVER = **PUBLIC IP**
```
For example, if the private IP address of your server is 192.168.1.100, you would replace the above line with:
```python
SERVER = '192.168.1.100'
```
If you want to use your public IP, you need to make sure that your router is properly configured to forward incoming traffic on port 5050 to the private IP address of your server. Additionally, some internet service providers may block incoming traffic on certain ports for security reasons. You may need to contact your ISP to confirm whether port 5050 is blocked on your network.

<blockquote>
  <p>Implicit conversion from data type varchar to varbinary(max) is not allowed. Use the CONVERT function to run this query.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please help me to solve this problem</p>
Response: You are trying to convert a varchar value to varbinary directly, which is not allowed. To fix this, you can first convert the varchar value to binary and then to varbinary as follows:
<pre><code>SELECT
    CONVERT(varbinary(MAX), CONVERT(binary, [report])) AS [report],
    ISNULL(CONVERT(varbinary(MAX), CONVERT(binary, [description])), 0x) AS [description]
FROM myTbl
</code></pre>
Here, we first convert the varchar values to binary using the CONVERT function and then convert the binary values to varbinary using the same function. We also handle the NULL values for the [description] column using the ISNULL function.
Note that for the [description] column, we initialize the default value to 0x, which represents an empty varbinary value. You can change this to any other default value as per your requirements.

Response: You can use the `melt` function from the `reshape2` package in R to achieve this. Here's how you can do it on your example data:
``` r
library(reshape2)
# Example data
df <- data.frame(CP000036 = c(0, "a", "b"),
                 CP001063 = c("a", 0, "c"),
                 CP001368 = c("b", "c", 0))
row.names(df) <- c("CP000036", "CP001063", "CP001368")
# Melt the data frame
melted_df <- melt(df, varnames = c("Genome1", "Genome2"), value.name = "Dist")
# Remove rows where Genome1 and Genome2 are the same
melted_df <- subset(melted_df, Genome1 != Genome2)
# Reorder columns
melted_df <- melted_df[, c("Genome1", "Genome2", "Dist")]
# Print the output
print(melted_df)
```
This will give you the first example output you provided:
```
    Genome1   Genome2 Dist
2  CP000036 CP001063    a
3  CP001063 CP001368    c
4  CP000036 CP001368    b
```
If you want the second example output with all combinations, you can remove the `subset` line:
``` r
library(reshape2)
# Example data
df <- data.frame(CP000036 = c(0, "a", "b"),
                 CP001063 = c("a", 0, "c"),
                 CP001368 = c("b", "c", 0))
row.names(df) <- c("CP000036", "CP001063", "CP001368")
# Melt the data frame
melted_df <- melt(df, varnames = c("Genome1", "Genome2"), value.name = "Dist")

Prompt: <p>Is there a way to manage repositories tags in Windows client of Github?</p>
<p>(and if not, how could I do this ?)</p>
Response: Yes, there is a way to manage repositories tags in the Windows client of GitHub. You can follow these steps:
1. Open the repository in the GitHub Windows client.
2. Click on the "Tags" tab in the top navigation bar.
3. Click on the "Create a Tag" button.
4. Fill in the tag name and description.
5. Choose the branch that you want to tag.
6. Click on the "Create Tag" button.
You can also delete or edit existing tags by selecting the tag from the list and clicking on the respective button.
If you prefer to use the command line, you can use the Git command to manage tags. Here is an example:
To create a tag, use the following command:
```
git tag <tag-name>
```
To delete a tag, use the following command:
```
git tag -d <tag-name>
```
To push tags to remote repositories, use the following command:
```
git push origin <tag-name>
```
To list all the tags, use the following command:
```
git tag
```

Prompt: <p>If I have an element with CSS style like code </p>
<pre><code>td class="bogus" style="padding-left: 1em;"
</code></pre>
<p>how can I use jQuery to get <code>padding-left</code> value as 1em instead of pixels?</p>
<pre><code>$(".bogus").css("padding-left");
</code></pre>
<p>This only returns the pixels, but I want it to return what's really in the code, in this case, relative value 1em instead. How ?</p>
<p>Thanks for any guide.</p>
<ul>
<li>Qu</li>
</ul>
Response: To get the computed value of the CSS property "padding-left" in the unit "em", you can use the jQuery function "css()" with the parameter "padding-left". Then, you can convert the value from pixels to em by dividing it by the computed font size of the element, which you can get using the jQuery function "css()" with the parameter "font-size". Here's an example:
<pre><code>var $bogus = $(".bogus");
var paddingLeftPx = parseInt($bogus.css("padding-left"));
var fontSizePx = parseInt($bogus.css("font-size"));
var paddingLeftEm = (paddingLeftPx / fontSizePx).toFixed(1); // round to one decimal place
console.log(paddingLeftEm + "em");</code></pre>
This code gets the element with the class "bogus" and stores it in the variable $bogus. Then, it gets the computed value of the "padding-left" property in pixels and stores it in the variable paddingLeftPx. It also gets the computed font size of the element in pixels and stores it in the variable fontSizePx. Finally, it calculates the value of the "padding-left" property in em by dividing paddingLeftPx by fontSizePx and rounds it to one decimal place using the toFixed() method. The value is logged to the console with "em" appended to it.

Response: Without seeing the full code and context, it's difficult to determine exactly what is causing the issue. However, one possibility is that the Fragment is not being properly handled during the button clicks, causing it to disappear or become hidden.
Here are a few suggestions to try and troubleshoot the problem:
1. Check if the Fragment is properly initialized before showing the BottomSheetDialogFragment. This could be done in the Fragment's onCreate or onCreateView method.
2. Make sure the Fragment reference is not lost during the button clicks. If the Fragment instance is lost, the UI may not update correctly or the Fragment may disappear altogether.
3. Verify that the BottomSheetDialogFragment is properly dismissed after the button clicks are handled. This could be done by calling dismiss() on the BottomSheetDialogFragment instance.
4. Consider using a callback or listener to handle the button clicks instead of directly modifying the Fragment's UI. This can help ensure proper communication between classes and prevent unexpected behavior.
If these suggestions do not solve the issue, it may be helpful to provide more context or code samples.

Prompt: <p>I am designing a PDF report with iReport 3.7.6, using an XML datasource which contains some prices (Money value), which are introduced a <code>textField</code> in my report, so I used the <code>pattern</code> <code>textField</code> property to set the currency format, but unfortunately it does not format it as i want.</p>
<p>Here you can see the value I want to format as currency in the XML file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;importFormalitzat&gt;1500.0&lt;/importFormalitzat&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is the JRXML code for the <code>textField</code> where I display the value:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;textField pattern="¤ #,##0.00" isBlankWhenNull="true"&gt;
    &lt;reportElement x="4" y="475" width="181" height="13"/&gt;
    &lt;textElement lineSpacing="Single"&gt;
       &lt;font size="8"/&gt;
    &lt;/textElement&gt;
    &lt;textFieldExpression class="java.lang.Double"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[$F{importFormalitzat} ]]&gt;&lt;/textFieldExpression&gt;
&lt;/textField&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see the pattern I am using to format the value is: <code>pattern="¤ #,##0.00"</code></p>
<p>But the result I get when I preview the report is this: <strong>15000,00</strong></p>
<p>I don't understand why I get 15000,00 while the value I have in the XML file from where I am filling the report is 1500.0.</p>
<p>I tried to change the Java class in the TextField expression to <code>Integer</code>, <code>BigDecimal</code>, but I still do not get the correct value in the report!</p>
Response: As per the pattern you have provided i.e "¤ #,##0.00", the currency symbol is set to default currency which is based on the Locale of your machine. In your case, it seems to be set to a currency with a higher value than the currency you want to use.
To solve this, you need to set the currency symbol and the locale explicitly in the pattern as shown below:
<pre><code>&lt;textField pattern="€ #,##0.00" isBlankWhenNull="true"&gt;
    &lt;reportElement x="4" y="475" width="181" height="13"/&gt;
    &lt;textElement lineSpacing="Single"&gt;
       &lt;font size="8"/&gt;
    &lt;/textElement&gt;
    &lt;textFieldExpression class="java.lang.Double"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[$F{importFormalitzat} ]]&gt;&lt;/textFieldExpression&gt;
&lt;/textField&gt;
</code></pre>
Here, I have set the currency symbol to "€" and the Locale is set implicitly as per the currency symbol. This should now format the value correctly in the report.
Also, make sure that the value in the XML file is in the correct format as per the Locale you have set in the pattern. For example, if your Locale is set to US, the value should be in the format "1,500.00" instead of "1500.0".

Prompt: <p>Summary: Running a "get-wmiobject" on another computer works properly. But when I "invoke-command" "get-wmiobject", I get access denied. </p>
<p>Detail: I have a workstation (Computer-Central) at our central site, from which I run an inventory script. The inventory script loops through several "get-wmi" commands for each IP on all our remote sites. If I log onto Computer-Central as a domain admin, the script works properly.</p>
<p>I'm now at one of those remote sites. My current workstation is (Computer-SiteA). So I can't log into Computer-Central directly; I have to RDP in. The trouble is, the RDP session times out before the script finishes (it takes about 12 hours). So I can't RDP in, start the script, and walk away. For various reasons, making a Scheduled Task is also out.</p>
<p>Powershell Remoting is enabled. I logged onto Computer-SiteA with my domain admin account and ran the following command:</p>
<pre><code>invoke-command -computername Computer-Central {dir c:}
</code></pre>
<p>This worked properly. So I kicked off the inventory script with the following command (again, run as domain admin on Computer-SiteA):</p>
<pre><code>invoke-command -computername Computer-Central -filepath c:\inventory.ps1
</code></pre>
<p>The script started and ran overnight. But the get-wmi commands all produced "Access Denied" errors.
I RDP'd into Computer-Central and ran the following command:</p>
<pre><code>get-wmiobject -class win32_computersystem -property name -computername Computer-SiteB
</code></pre>
<p>This worked properly. I got the WMI information back.</p>
<p>Then I logged onto Computer-SiteA and ran the following command:</p>
<pre><code>invoke-command -computername Computer-Central {get-wmiobject -class     win32_computersystem -property name -computername Computer-SiteB}
</code></pre>
<p>This failed with "Access Denied." I logged on as Domain Admin and even did a "Run As Different User" to make sure the PS console was open as my domain admin account. </p>
<p>I'm very confused by this. "Invoke-Command" should start the Powershell.exe process on the remote system with the credentials I've used on the local PC. The "get-wmiobject" command should pass the WMI query from the remote PC to the target PC, again with the same credentials. But that doesn't seem to be the case. </p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>EDIT: I ran this command to make Computer-Central query itself.</p>
<pre><code>invoke-command -computername Computer-Central {get-wmiobject -class     win32_computersystem -property name -computername Computer-Central}
</code></pre>
<p>That worked. If I invoke "get-wmiobject" on the remote system targeting itself, it works. If I invoke "get-wmiobject" on the remote system targeting a third system, it fails. I hope this helps.</p>
Response: It seems that the issue is with the lack of proper credentials being passed on to the remote system when invoking the get-wmiobject command. One possible solution would be to use the -credential parameter with the invoke-command cmdlet to explicitly pass on the domain admin credentials to the remote system. The updated command would look like this:
invoke-command -computername Computer-Central -filepath c:\inventory.ps1 -credential domain\username
This should allow the get-wmiobject command to run successfully on the remote system with the proper permissions.

Prompt: <p>Aprox answer is sufficient.
I am suppose to check if 2 rectangles of same size overlap or not
1) Existing code checks if all (x,y) of one rectangle is withing the all (x,y) of another. So making 16 comparisons in total
2) My improvement - Calculating distance between upperl-left corner's of each rectangle and checking if this distance is smaller than diagonal of the rectangle.</p>
<p>Also any book/material that discusses about number of CPU clock cycles/time each operation in coding takes to execute once on CPU is appreciated.</p>
Response: Your improvement is a good one and will be more efficient than checking all 16 comparisons. However, it's worth noting that the distance between the upper-left corners is not necessarily smaller than the diagonal of the rectangle (consider rectangles that are very tall and narrow).
As for your question about CPU clock cycles, there are many factors that can affect how long an operation takes to execute, such as the specific CPU model, clock speed, and memory latency. The best resource for this information would be the documentation for your specific CPU or compiler.

Prompt: <p>i have an ArrayList that's used to buffer data so that other threads can read them</p>
<p>this array constantly has data added to it since it's reading from a udp source, and the other threads constantly reading from that array.Then the data is removed from the array.</p>
<p>this is not the actual code but a simplified example :</p>
<pre><code> public class PacketReader implements Runnable{
   pubic static ArrayList&lt;Packet&gt; buffer = new ArrayList() ;
    @Override
    public void run(){
    while(bActive){

 public class Player implements Runnable(){
 @Override
 public void run(){
 //read packet from buffer
 //decode packets
 // now for the problem :
 PacketReader.buffer.remove(the packet that's been read);
     }
   }
</code></pre>
<p>The remove() method removes packets from the array and then shifts all the packets on the right to the left to cover the void.</p>
<p>My concern is : since the buffer is constantly being added to and read from by multiple threads , would the remove() method make issues since its gonna have to shift packets to the left? </p>
<p>i mean if .add() or .get() methods get called on that arraylist at the same time that shift is being done would it be a problem ?</p>
<p>i do get index out of bounds exception sometimes and its something like :
index : 100  size 300 , which is strange cuz index is within size , so i want to know if this is what may possibly be causing the problem or should i look for other problems .</p>
<p>thank you</p>
Response: As you suspected, there is a potential concurrency issue with removing elements from the ArrayList while other threads are reading from or writing to it. This can result in a variety of issues, including index out of bounds exceptions.
One solution to this issue is to use a concurrent data structure, such as a ConcurrentLinkedQueue, instead of an ArrayList, which will allow multiple threads to access the buffer without requiring explicit synchronization.
Alternatively, you can use explicit synchronization to ensure that only one thread at a time is modifying the ArrayList. This can be achieved by enclosing the remove() call in a synchronized block, like so:
<pre><code>synchronized(PacketReader.buffer){
    PacketReader.buffer.remove(the packet that's been read);
}</code></pre>
This will ensure that other threads will not be able to modify the ArrayList while you are removing an element from it.
However, it's worth noting that even with explicit synchronization, you may still run into issues if other threads are accessing the ArrayList while you are blocking them with the synchronized block. This can lead to deadlock or other performance issues.
In general, it's best to use a concurrent data structure or another synchronization mechanism that is better suited to your specific use case.

<p>But due to firestore's limitation, I won't be able to use &quot;in&quot; twice so have to use something like querying by color and size separately and combine the results together (using Promise) but that won't solve the problem of pagination. Please give me the solution?</p>
Response: One solution to this problem is to use a compound query. Instead of using multiple "where" clauses, we can create a compound index on the "color", "size", and "name" fields. This index will allow us to search for documents based on all three fields at the same time.
To create a compound index in Firestore, go to the Cloud Firestore console, select your collection, and click on "Indexes". Then click on "Add Index" and select "Single field".
Enter the first field ("color") and select "Ascending" or "Descending". Then click on "Add another field" and repeat the process for the other fields ("size" and "name").
Once the index is created, you can use the following query to search for documents based on all three fields:
```
var searchTerm = "Chiwawa";
var query = dogsCollection
    .where("color", "==", "Black")
    .where("size", "==", "Small")
    .orderBy("color")
    .orderBy("size")
    .orderBy("name")
    .startAt("Black", "Small", searchTerm)
    .endAt("Black", "Small", searchTerm + "\uf8ff")
    .limit(2);
```
In this example, we are searching for documents where the "color" field is "Black" and the "size" field is "Small". We are also using the "orderBy" method to order the results by "color", "size", and "name". Finally, we are using the "startAt" and "endAt" methods to specify the range of results we want to retrieve based on the "name" field.
Note that the "startAt" and "endAt" methods must include all the fields in the compound index in the same order as they were defined. This allows Firestore to use the index efficiently to retrieve the results.
By using a compound query and a compound index, we can search for documents based on multiple fields and still be able to use pagination.

Prompt: <p>As per <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/zdtaw1bw.aspx?cs-save-lang=1&amp;cs-lang=csharp#code-snippet-2" rel="nofollow">this C# code from Mircrosoft</a> there is a standard date format such as this:</p>
<pre><code>//       R: Sun, 15 Jun 2008 21:15:07 GMT
</code></pre>
<p>My C# code uses "r" like so:</p>
<pre><code>webRequest.Date.ToUniversalTime().ToString("r")
</code></pre>
<p>How can I create a standard date format like this in Java?</p>
<p>I have this so far:</p>
<pre><code>this.timestamp = new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z").format(new Date());
</code></pre>
<p>But, I don't know if I should try to write something that will match it or if there is a better way.  My fear is that I will make a mistake and certain dates won't work.</p>
Response: You can format a date in Java using the following code:
<pre><code>// Create a Date object
Date date = new Date();
// Format the date using SimpleDateFormat
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z");
String formattedDate = sdf.format(date);
// Print the formatted date
System.out.println(formattedDate);
</code></pre>
This will output a date in the format "EEE, d MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z", which is similar to the "R" format used in C#.
However, keep in mind that some of the date format options may not be exactly the same between the two languages. It's always a good idea to test your date formatting thoroughly to make sure it's giving you the results you expect.

<p>I have an admin user and logged into compass with it. I gave the user <strong>userAdminAnyDatabase</strong> and I am very confused.</p>
Response: It appears that the user you have logged in as does not have the necessary privileges to execute the command to list collections in the guilds database.
Make sure that the user you have logged in as has the following permissions granted:
- readWriteAnyDatabase or dbOwner role in the guilds database
- clusterAdmin or clusterManager role on the entire cluster
You can grant these roles using the following command in the mongo shell:
```
use admin
db.grantRolesToUser("username",[{role:"readWriteAnyDatabase", db: "guilds"}, {role:"clusterAdmin", db:"admin"}])
```
Replace "username" with the actual username of the user you want to grant the roles to.
Once you have granted the necessary roles, try creating the database again and see if the issue persists.

Prompt: <p>How to check file owner in linux</p>
<p>i am trying to run this bash file</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
uname2=$(ls -l $1 | awk '{print $3}');
if [ $uname2 == $USER ]
then echo owner
else echo no owner
fi
</code></pre>
<p>it gives error ==' unary operator expected.
what is wrong? ubuntu server 10.04.</p>
Response: The error is caused by an empty variable `$uname2`. This can happen if the file specified by `$1` does not exist. You can add an additional check to make sure the file exists before attempting to retrieve its owner:
```
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -e "$1" ]; then
  echo "File not found: $1"
  exit 1
fi
uname2=$(ls -l "$1" | awk '{print $3}');
if [ "$uname2" == "$USER" ]; then
  echo "Owner"
else
  echo "No owner"
fi
```
This script first checks if the file specified by `$1` exists using the `[ -e FILENAME ]` test. If it does not exist, an error is printed and the script exits with status code `1`.
If the file exists, its owner is retrieved using `ls -l` piped through `awk` to print the third field (owner's username).
Finally, it compares the owner's username with the current user's username (stored in `$USER`) and prints either "Owner" or "No owner" accordingly.
Note that using `ls` to get the owner of a file can be problematic if the filename contains spaces or other special characters. It is generally better to use `stat` or `find` for this purpose.

<p>PS:I want to generate a page like <a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILeri.png" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/ILeri.png" alt="enter image description here"></a></p>
<p>By click the items on the sidebar, I want to load the corresponding <code>asp.net</code> in the mainpage</p>
Response: It seems like you are trying to mix two different approaches to updating the content of a page dynamically - AJAX and UpdatePanel.
In your current code, you are using the AJAX approach to load the content of the <code>QuesEdit.aspx</code> page into the <code>mainPage</code> div. However, when you try to update the content of <code>QuesEdit.aspx</code> using an UpdatePanel, the whole page is being refreshed because UpdatePanel is not compatible with AJAX approach.
To achieve your desired functionality, you should use either AJAX or UpdatePanel consistently throughout your project. Here's how you can use AJAX to update the content of <code>QuesEdit.aspx</code>:
In the <code>QuesEdit.aspx</code> page, you should wrap the content that needs to be updated in a <code>div</code> and give it an ID, like so:
<pre><code>&lt;div id="updatePanelContent"&gt;
  ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>
Then, in the click event of the button that needs to trigger the update, you can make an AJAX call to a method in the codebehind of the <code>QuesEdit.aspx</code> page that will update the <code>updatePanelContent</code> div. Here's an example:
In the <code>QuesEdit.aspx</code> page, add a method in the codebehind that will update the content of the <code>updatePanelContent</code> div:
<pre><code>protected void UpdateContent()
{
  // Update your content here
  ...
}
</code></pre>
In the JavaScript code, call this method using AJAX:
<pre><code>function updateQuesEditContent() {
  $.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "QuesEdit.aspx/UpdateContent",
    contentType: "application/json; charset=utf-8",
    dataType: "json",
    success: function(result) {
      // Update the "updatePanelContent" div with the result
      $('#updatePanelContent').html(result.d);
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>
Finally, in the button click event, call the <code>updateQuesEditContent</code> function:
<pre><code>&lt;asp:Button ID="btnUpdate" runat="server" Text="Update" OnClientClick="updateQuesEditContent(); return false;" /&gt;
</code></pre>
This will update the content of the <code>updatePanelContent</code> div using AJAX, without causing a full page refresh. Note that this code assumes that you are using a WebMethod in the codebehind of the <code>QuesEdit.aspx</code> page to update the content.

Prompt: <p>Is there a way to obtain the wifi security type of the network that the device is currently connected. I know that wifi security could be obtained by scanning network. but is it possible without scanning so that I can get it for the current wifi network??</p>
Response: Yes, it is possible to obtain the wifi security type of the network that the device is currently connected to without scanning. On most devices, you can go to the wifi settings and select the network you are connected to. The security type of the network should be listed there. However, if the network is hidden, you may need to scan for it in order to obtain its security type.

Prompt: <p>I am using the Eclipse plugin framework to write an editor for a specific language. I would like to implement a Find Reference capability for this language and write the results to the eclipse Search View. I've been searching the web for a few days now, and all I found was explanations on how the define the org.eclipse.search.searchResultViewPages extension point and define a search page and a search view. I am only interested in the Search View and how I can plug in my own results to it.
Thanks!</p>
Response: One way to implement a Find Reference capability for your language is to use the org.eclipse.search extension point to contribute a search participant. This search participant can accept search requests from the Search View and perform the actual search in your language-specific code. Once the search results are found, they can be converted into search matches and added to the Eclipse search infrastructure. The search matches can then be displayed in the Search View like any other search results.
Here are the basic steps to implement a search participant:
1. Define a new extension point for your search participant. The extension should define the class that implements the org.eclipse.search.ui.ISearchPageContainer interface. This class will be responsible for setting up the search page UI and performing the search.
2. Implement the ISearchPageContainer interface in your search participant class. This will involve creating a search page with the appropriate search criteria fields and buttons, handling search requests from the Search View, and returning the search results as an instance of the org.eclipse.search.ui.ISearchResult interface.
3. Implement the org.eclipse.search.ui.ISearchResult interface to define your search results. This will involve creating an instance of the org.eclipse.search.ui.SearchResult class and adding search matches to it. Search matches can be created using the org.eclipse.search.ui.SearchMatch class, which takes a file, line number, and other information about the match.
4. Register your search participant with the org.eclipse.search extension point. This will allow your search participant to be discovered by the Eclipse search infrastructure and displayed in the Search View.
Once your search participant is registered, you can test it by opening the Search View (Window > Show View > Other > General > Search), selecting your search participant from the drop-down list, entering some search criteria, and clicking the Search button. If everything is set up correctly, your search results should be displayed in the Search View.
For more information on implementing search participants in Eclipse, see the Eclipse documentation on the org.eclipse.search extension point.

Prompt: <p>I am trying to implement OAuth to one of my companies' projects and can't resolve the following problem.</p>
<p>We used <code>IdentityServer4</code> for implementing our own Authorization Server, which works fine so far. The resource I want to protect with OAuth is a WebApi utilizing <code>Swagger/Swashbuckle</code>.</p>
<p>I followed the <code>IdentityServer4 QuickStartExamples</code> to configure the server and this tutorial [Secure Web APIs with Swagger, Swashbuckle, and OAuth2 (part 2)](<a href="http://knowyourtoolset.com/2015/08/secure-web-apis-with-swagger-swashbuckle-and-oauth2-part-2" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://knowyourtoolset.com/2015/08/secure-web-apis-with-swagger-swashbuckle-and-oauth2-part-2</a> for configuring Swagger/Swashbuckle). </p>
<p>I have a dummy-action which does nothing else than returning a string, that works as expected.</p>
<p>When I decorate the action with <code>[Authorize]</code>, a little red icon appears in swagger-ui, indicating that I have to log in to access this method. The Login process works fine: I am redirected to the Quickstart-UI, can login with the testuser "Bob", and I am redirected to swagger-ui after a successful login.
The problem: After the successful login, I still get an 401 error, stating "Authorization has been denied for this request." </p>
<p>I can see that a bearer token is returned by my IdentityServer in swagger-ui, so I guess this part working fine and the problem seems to be swagger/swashbuckle.</p>
<p>Is there maybe anything else I have to do with the token? In the tutorials I read so far, the swagger config is modified as I did it (see below) and that's it, so I guess swagger/swashbuckle should handle this - but maybe I miss out something?  </p>
<p>SwaggerConfig.cs:</p>
<pre><code>c.OAuth2("oauth2")
    .Description("OAuth2 Implicit Grant")
    .Flow("implicit") //also available: password, application (=client credentials?)
    .AuthorizationUrl("http://localhost:5000/connect/authorize")

Response: It seems like the issue might be in the configuration of your IdentityServer client. Specifically, the `RedirectUris` and `PostLogoutRedirectUris` properties are set to `http://localhost:5858/swagger/ui/o2c-html`, which may not be the correct URL for the Swagger UI in your project.
Double-check that these URIs match the actual Swagger UI URL in your project. If they do not, update the values accordingly and try again.
Additionally, make sure that the client has been properly configured with the correct scopes and permissions to access the protected resource.

Prompt: <p>I'm having a very difficult time trying to achieve something simple with the <code>Grid</code> Component from MaterialUI. Specifically, I'd like to align one item to the left, and another to the right on one layout row.</p>
<p>I've searched extensively, and have not found any solutions that work. I've tried many suggestions, including the use of <code>justifyContent</code> and <code>alignContent</code> within a <code>Grid</code> component, and within JSS, and the <code>flex: 1</code> technique of 'pushing' content.</p>
<h3>Relevant Code Snippets</h3>
<p>Trying to put the <code>&lt;Typography&gt;</code> element on the left, and the <code>&lt;FormGroup&gt;</code> on the right:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Container&gt;
  &lt;Grid container spacing={3}&gt;
    &lt;Grid className={classes.rowLayout}&gt;
      // Goal is to align this to the LEFT
      &lt;Grid item xs={6}&gt;
        &lt;Typography variant=&quot;h6&quot; gutterBottom&gt;Some Text&lt;/Typography&gt;
      &lt;/Grid&gt;
      // Goal is to align this to the RIGHT
      &lt;Grid item xs={3}&gt;
        &lt;FormGroup&gt;
          // Simple `Switch` button goes here
        &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
      &lt;/Grid&gt;
    &lt;/Grid&gt;
  &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/Container&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>MaterialUI JSS styling:</p>
<pre><code>const useStyles = makeStyles(theme =&gt; ({
  root: {
    flexGrow: 1,
    width: '100%'
  },
  rowLayout: {
    display: 'flex',
    alignItems: 'baseline'
  },
}));
</code></pre>
<p>I'm also finding that, generally speaking, this is requiring the use of many <code>Grid</code> components, and I'd love to write cleaner code if possible.</p>
<p>Do you have any tips or fixes to this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks a million,</p>
<p>Davis</p>
Response: Dear Davis,
To achieve your desired layout, you can use two <code>Grid</code> items with the same width and put them inside a parent <code>Grid</code> container with <code>justifyContent="space-between"</code>. Here's the code example:
<pre><code>&lt;Grid container justifyContent="space-between" spacing={3}&gt;
  &lt;Grid item xs={6}&gt;
    &lt;Typography variant="h6" gutterBottom&gt;Some Text&lt;/Typography&gt;
  &lt;/Grid&gt;
  &lt;Grid item xs={6} container justifyContent="flex-end"&gt;
    &lt;FormGroup&gt;
      &lt;FormControlLabel control=&lt;Switch /&gt; label="Some Label" /&gt;
    &lt;/FormGroup&gt;
  &lt;/Grid&gt;
&lt;/Grid&gt;</code></pre>
By default, the <code>Grid</code> item takes up the available space on the row. However, by setting its width to 6, the first item will take up half of the row, leaving the other half for the second item. The parent <code>Grid</code> container has <code>justifyContent="space-between"</code>, which will evenly distribute the child elements along the main axis of the container, pushing the first item to the left and the second item to the right.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
Best,
Material-UI Helper.

<p>This is my error message:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Cannot find the static member 'ForegroundProperty' on the type 'ContentPresenter'.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>sm:Severity is an enumeration I imported.</p>
Response: The issue seems to be with the line where you are setting the Foreground property of the TextBlock using a DataTrigger. Try setting the property to a SolidColorBrush instead of just a color value. Like this:
<code>&lt;Setter TargetName="SeverityText"
        Property="Foreground"
        Value="Yellow" /&gt;</code>
Change it to:
<code>&lt;Setter TargetName="SeverityText"
        Property="Foreground"
        Value="Yellow" /&gt;
&lt;Setter TargetName="SeverityText"
        Property="Foreground"
        Value="{StaticResource YellowColorBrush}" /&gt;</code>
By setting the value with a SolidColorBrush, it should resolve the issue with the ContentPresenter not finding the ForegroundProperty. Make sure you have defined the SolidColorBrush in your resources, like this:
<code>&lt;SolidColorBrush x:Key="YellowColorBrush" Color="Yellow"/&gt;</code>

Prompt: <p>While trying timestamp in <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/11/javadoc/org/apache/kafka/clients/producer/ProducerRecord.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">ProducerRecord</a>; I found something weird. After sending few messages from the producer, I ran kafka-console-consumer.sh and verified that those messages are in the topic. I stopped the producer and waited for a minute. When I reran kafka-console-consumer.sh then it did not show the messages that I generated previously. I also added producer.flush() and producer.close() but the outcome was still the same.</p>
<p>Now, when I stopped using timestamp field then everything worked fine which makes me believe that there is something finicky about messages with timestamp.</p>
<p>I am using Kafka_2.11-2.0.0 (released on July 30, 2018)</p>
<p>Following is the sample code.</p>
<pre><code>import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.KafkaProducer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.Producer;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerConfig;
import org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.ProducerRecord;
import org.apache.kafka.common.header.internal.RecordHeaders;
import org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer;
import java.util.Properties;
import static java.lang.Thread.sleep;
public class KafkaProducerSample{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        String kafkaHost="sample:port";
        String notificationTopic="test";
        Properties props = new Properties();
        props.put(ProducerConfig.BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS_CONFIG, this.kafkaHost);
        props.put(ProducerConfig.ACKS_CONFIG, 1);
        props.put(ProducerConfig.RETRIES_CONFIG, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        Producer&lt;String, String&gt; producer = new KafkaProducer(props, new StringSerialize(), new StringSerializer);
        RecordHeaders recordHeaders = new RecordHeader();
        ProducerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record = new ProducerRecord(notificationTopic, null, 1574443515L, sampleKey, SampleValue);
        producer.send(record);
        sleep(1000);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I run console consumer as following</p>
<pre><code>$KAFKA_HOME/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap.server KAFKA_HOST:PORT --topic test --from-beginning
#output after running producer
test
#output 5mins after shutting down producer
</code></pre>
Response: <p>The issue here is with the value of the timestamp that you are using in the ProducerRecord. In your code, you are setting the timestamp to a fixed value (1574443515L) which is not within the default retention period (7 days) of Kafka. This means that the messages with that timestamp value will be automatically deleted from the topic after the retention period expires, and thus will not be available for consumers to read.</p>
<p>To solve this, you can either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set the timestamp to the current system time when sending the message:</li>
<pre><code>ProducerRecord&lt;String, String&gt; record = new ProducerRecord(notificationTopic, null, System.currentTimeMillis(), sampleKey, sampleValue);
</code></pre>
<p>This will ensure that the messages are within the retention period and will be available for consumers to read until the retention period expires.</p>
<li>Change the retention period of the Kafka broker to a longer period:</li>
<p>You can change the retention period by setting the <code>log.retention.hours</code> property in the Kafka broker configuration file (<code>server.properties</code>). For example, to set the retention period to 30 days:</p>
<pre><code>log.retention.hours=720</code></pre>
<p>After making this change, you need to restart the Kafka broker for the new configuration to take effect.</p>
</ol>
<p>Either of these solutions should resolve the issue you are facing with messages not being available for consumers to read after a certain period of time.</p>

<p>for example :
for the groupe A in avr  :<br>
( Nombre de responsable for groupe A  / total somme type a-month ) = 1/2 = 0.5 </p>
<p>how can i do this ? </p>
Response: You can achieve this by creating a new calculated field in the pivot table. Follow these steps:
1. Click anywhere in the pivot table.
2. In the PivotTable Analyze tab, click Fields, Items & Sets.
3. Select Calculated Field.
4. In the Name box, enter a name for the new field, e.g. "Responsables par somme".
5. In the Formula box, enter the following formula: = 'Nombre de responsable' / 'total somme type a-month'
6. Click Add.
7. The new field will now appear in the Values area of the pivot table. You can right-click on it and select Value Field Settings to format it as a percentage or decimal, as desired.
8. Finally, to get the desired result, you can copy and paste the Values column to a new sheet, then filter and sort by the group and month columns to see the calculated values for each group and month.
Note: This method assumes that the "Nombre de responsable" and "total somme type a-month" fields are already part of the pivot table. If they are not, you will need to add them before creating the calculated field.

Response: One way to achieve this is by using the "vertical-align:top;" property in the second column's CSS. Here is the updated code:
<pre><code>&lt;table border="0"&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;F1&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;ALMS&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Le Mans 24 Hour&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;WTCCBritish GT&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;BTCC&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Toca support races&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;/ul&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="vertical-align:top;"&gt;
     &lt;a href="http://www.motorground.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/track-day-0732.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.motorground.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/track-day-0732-300x200.jpg" alt="PrivateTuitionimg073" width="300" height="200" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-23" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
In this code, we have added the "style" attribute to the second column and set its value as "vertical-align:top;". This CSS property aligns the content at the top of the cell, preventing it from moving the content in the first column downwards.

<p>I can't catch timeout exception and print error message and continue to work. I thought " except: " catches all errors that happen. I tried to set " except socket.timeout: " but unsuccessfully. What did I wrong?</p>
Response: The "except:" statement catches all exceptions, but it is generally not recommended to use it because it makes it difficult to debug problems. In your case, you can catch the socket.timeout exception specifically by adding it to the except statement:
<pre><code>def testConnection(self):
    try:
        self.imap.login(self.user, self.password)
        return True
    except socket.timeout:
        print("Connection timed out")
        return False
    except Exception as e:
        print("Exception: {}".format(e))
        return False
</code></pre>
This will catch the socket.timeout exception and print an error message, while still catching all other exceptions and printing a generic error message.

<p>I don't believe that the problem is a local folder permissions problem, because I have a) checked the permissions on the folder manually and b) The ESB will move the file that I place in the 'pollfolder' to either 'Output' or 'Processed' if I set the transport.vfs.MoveAfterProcess property to that value, so it is possible to write to both these folders.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. </p>
Response: The error message seems to indicate that the ESB does not have permission to write to the "c:\wso2\processed" folder. You mentioned that you have checked the folder permissions manually, but it may still be worth double-checking to make sure that the user account running the ESB process has write permission to that folder.
Another thing to try would be to use a different folder location for the output file, just to rule out any issues specific to that folder. For example, you could try changing the "transport.vfs.MoveAfterProcess" parameter to "file:///C:/temp" and see if the ESB is able to write to that folder.
Finally, it may be useful to turn on debug logging for the VFS transport, which could provide more detailed information about why the write is failing. To do this, add the following parameter to the proxy configuration:
```
<parameter name="transport.vfs.FTP_DEBUG" value="true"/>
```
This will enable debug logging for the VFS transport, which should appear in the ESB logs.

<p>I'm using a simple heuristic that the guy(s?) who created and maintain virtualenvwrapper is(are) much smarter than I am - however, not (automagically) adding the newly created environment to the path, reeks of incompetence bordering on malice.</p>
<p>It is highly unlikely (no, impossible) that the developer/mainteners are that incompetent - which leaves the only possible explanation to be that I'm missing something obvious and doing something foolish.</p>
<p>SO (pun unintended) - <strong>WHAT AM I DOING WRONG?!</strong></p>
<p>Why can't I simply execute <code>python djan-admin.py startproject xxx</code> after creating a new virt environment using virtualenvwrapper?</p>
Response: It seems like you are missing the `django-admin.py` file in your virtual environment. Even though you have installed Django and it is listed in your pip list, it might not be available in your current virtual environment's path.
To solve this, you can try activating your virtual environment and checking if `django-admin.py` is available by running:
```
source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
which django-admin.py
```
If you get a path as output, then `django-admin.py` is available in your virtual environment's path. If not, then it means that it is not available and you need to find out why.
One possible cause could be that the location where `django-admin.py` is installed is not added to your $PATH environment variable. To check this, run:
```
echo $PATH
```
This will print out the directories in your $PATH. Make sure that the directory containing `django-admin.py` is listed in your $PATH.
If the directory is not listed in your $PATH, you can add it by appending the following line to your virtual environment's activate script:
```
export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/directory/containing/django-admin.py
```
After this, deactivate and re-activate your virtual environment for the changes to take effect:
```
deactivate
source /path/to/virtualenv/bin/activate
```
Now, running `which django-admin.py` should output the correct path and you should be able to run `python django-admin.py startproject xxx` without any issues.

Prompt: <p>Is it possible in some way to add an element ( <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> in this case) in between the anchor tag and the image tag via javascript/jquery?
high prefer if it can be possible using the id of the img tag.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;div&gt;abc&lt;/div&gt;&lt;img id="123" src="..."&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>
Response: Yes, it is possible to add an element between the anchor tag and the image tag using JavaScript/jQuery. Here is one way to do it using the ID of the img tag:
<pre><code>var img = document.getElementById('123');
var parent = img.parentNode;
var div = document.createElement('div');
div.innerHTML = 'abc';
parent.insertBefore(div, img.nextSibling);
</code></pre>
This code first gets the element with ID '123' using `document.getElementById`. Then it gets the parent node of the img tag using the `parentNode` property. It creates a new div element using `document.createElement` and sets its innerHTML to 'abc'. Finally, it uses `insertBefore` to insert the new div element as the next sibling of the img tag. This will result in the second HTML code example you provided. To get the first example, you would need to use `parent.insertBefore(div, img)` instead.

<p>i find out some difference about the two event;<strong><em>handleTap</em></strong> or <strong><em>handleLongPress</em></strong> is fired in different scene. so any solution to capture the long press event or disable the system's long press event then add my own long press event to handle long event on linkedText in UITextView? </p>
Response: One possible solution is to add a UITapGestureRecognizer to your UITextView that recognizes long press gesture. Then, in the handler function of the UITapGestureRecognizer, you can check if the gesture was a long press and handle it accordingly.
Here is some sample code that you can use as a reference:
```
UITapGestureRecognizer *longPressRecognizer = [[UITapGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(handleLongPress:)];
longPressRecognizer.numberOfTapsRequired = 0;
longPressRecognizer.numberOfTouchesRequired = 1;
longPressRecognizer.minimumPressDuration = 0.5;
[yourTextView addGestureRecognizer:longPressRecognizer];
- (void)handleLongPress:(UITapGestureRecognizer *)gestureRecognizer {
    if (gestureRecognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) {
        CGPoint location = [gestureRecognizer locationInView:gestureRecognizer.view];
        // Check if the touch was on a link in the text view
        UITextView *textView = (UITextView *)gestureRecognizer.view;
        NSLayoutManager *layoutManager = textView.layoutManager;
        NSTextContainer *textContainer = textView.textContainer;
        NSInteger charIndex = [layoutManager characterIndexForPoint:location inTextContainer:textContainer fractionOfDistanceBetweenInsertionPoints:nil];
        if (charIndex < textView.textStorage.length) {
            NSRange range;
            NSURL *url = [textView.attributedText attribute:NSLinkAttributeName atIndex:charIndex effectiveRange:&range];
            if (url) {
                // Handle the long press event on the link
                // Example: Show a custom menu
                CGRect rect = [textView firstRectForRange:range];
                UIMenuController *menuController = [UIMenuController sharedMenuController];
                [menuController setTargetRect:rect inView:textView];
                [menuController setMenuVisible:YES animated:YES];
            }
        }
    }
}
```
In this code, we add a UITapGestureRecognizer to the UITextView and set its properties so that it recognizes a long press gesture. In the handler function, we check if the touch was on a link in the text view by using the NSLayoutManager and NSTextContainer objects to get the character index of the touch point and checking if the NSAttributedString at that index contains a link attribute. If it does, we handle the long press event on the link by showing a custom menu using UIMenuController.
Note: If you want to disable the system's long press gesture recognizer, you can set the UITextView's `linkTextAttributes` property to disable the underline and change the color to match the rest of the text. However, this will also disable the tap gesture recognizer. Therefore, you will need to handle the tap and long press gestures separately with your own gesture recognizers.

<pre><code>Expected map for property [fields] on field [dynamic_templates] but got a class java.lang.String

<p>Why do I get this error?</p>
Response: The error is occurring because the `dynamic_templates` field expects an array of objects, but you provided it with a string. To fix this, you need to wrap your `localized_strings_values` object with an array like this:
```
{
  "iam": {
    "properties": {
      "dynamic_templates": [
        {
          "localized_strings": {
            "path_match": "description.localizedDescriptions.*",
            "mapping": {
              "type": "string",
              "analyzer": "word_join_analyzer"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
This should apply the `word_join_analyzer` to all string values in the `localizedDescriptions` map.

</code></pre>
<p>From what I gather, here's how the expression is parsed by the compiler:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preprocessor tokenization: <code>--</code> <code>++</code> <code>a</code> <code>--</code> <code>++</code> <code>+</code> <code>b</code> <code>--</code>;</li>
<li>Operator precedence<sup>1</sup>: <code>(--(++((a--)++))) + (b--)</code>;</li>
<li><code>+</code> is left-to-right associative, but nonetheless the compiler may choose to evaluate the expression on the right (<code>b--</code>) first.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm assuming the compiler chooses to do it this way because it leads to better optimized code (less instructions). However, it's worth noting that I get the same result when compiling with <code>/Od</code> (MSVC) and <code>-O0</code> (GCC). This brings me to my question:</p>
<p>Since I was asked this on a test which should <em>in principle</em> be implementation/compiler-agnostic, <strong>is there something in the C++ standard that prescribes the above behavior, or is it truly unspecified?</strong> Can someone quote an excerpt from the standard which confirms either? Was it wrong to have such a question on the test?</p>
<p><sub><sup>1</sup> <em>I realize the compiler doesn't really know about operator precedence or associativity, rather it cares only about the language grammar, but this should get the point across either way.</em></sub></p>
Response: According to the C++ standard (section 5.2.6), the order of evaluation of function arguments is unspecified. This means that in the expression <code>f(a, b)</code>, either <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> could be evaluated first. In this case, the expression <code>b--</code> and <code>--++a--++</code> are function arguments to the overloaded operator+ function, so their order of evaluation is unspecified. Therefore, it is up to the compiler to choose the order of evaluation, and it may differ between compilers and optimization levels.
In conclusion, the behavior in this specific case is unspecified according to the C++ standard, and it's not necessarily wrong to have such a question on the test, as long as this fact is made clear to the students.

Prompt: <p>Lets say my URL is:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://example.com" rel="nofollow">http://example.com</a><strong>/12434/example-post</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to check if the current URL contains something after the <code>"/"</code>, in other words, I wan't to check whether or not I'm at the homepage <a href="http://example.com" rel="nofollow">http://example.com</a></p>
<p>Is this possible with jQuery?</p>
Response: No, this is not possible with jQuery alone. jQuery is a JavaScript library that can manipulate the content on a webpage, but it does not have access to the URL of the webpage directly. To check the current URL, you can use JavaScript's built-in <code>window.location</code> object or the <code>window.location.href</code> property. Here's an example of how you can use it to check if the current URL has anything after the <code>"/"</code>:</p>
<pre><code>if (window.location.href.split('/').length &gt; 3) {
  // There is something after the first slash (e.g. "/12434/example-post")
} else {
  // The URL is just the homepage (e.g. "http://example.com/")
}</code></pre>
<p>This code splits the <code>window.location.href</code> string by the slash character and checks if the resulting array has more than three elements (the first being "http:", the second being an empty string, and the third being the domain name). If it has more than three elements, it means there is something after the first slash, and therefore the URL is not just the homepage.</p>

Response: The error message suggests that the context passed to `BlocProvider.of<LoginListingBloc>(context)` does not contain a `Bloc` of type `LoginListingBloc`. This might be because the `BlocProvider` widget is not properly set up.
To fix this error, make sure that you wrap the widget that needs the `LoginListingBloc` instance with a `BlocProvider` widget, and pass in the `LoginListingBloc` instance as the `bloc` argument. In your case, it looks like you have already done this in the `build` method of your `HomePage` widget.
However, when you try to use `BlocProvider.of<LoginListingBloc>(context)` in the `onPressed` callback of the `RaisedButton`, the `context` you pass in might not contain the `BlocProvider` widget you created earlier. This could happen if the widget tree has changed since the widget was built.
To fix this, you can use a `Builder` widget to create a new context that contains the `BlocProvider` widget. Here's how you can modify your `RaisedButton` to use `Builder`:
```
RaisedButton(
  child: Text(
    'click here',
    style: defaultButtonStyle,
  ),
  onPressed: () {
    // Create new context that contains the BlocProvider widget
    final contextWithBloc = context;
    while (BlocProvider.of<LoginListingBloc>(contextWithBloc, listen: false) == null) {
      contextWithBloc = contextWithBloc.ancestorStateOfType(TypeMatcher<State>());
    }
    // Dispatch event using new context
    BlocProvider.of<LoginListingBloc>(contextWithBloc).dispatch(LoginEvent(loginInfoModel: testLogin));
  },
),
```
In this updated `onPressed` callback, we first create a new context called `contextWithBloc` that starts with the original context. Then, we loop through the ancestors of `contextWithBloc` until we find a widget of type `State` that has a `LoginListingBloc` instance. We use `BlocProvider.of<LoginListingBloc>(contextWithBloc, listen: false)` to get the `LoginListingBloc` instance, and pass `listen: false` to avoid triggering a rebuild. Once we have the `LoginListingBloc` instance, we use `BlocProvider.of<LoginListingBloc>(contextWithBloc)` to dispatch the `LoginEvent`.

Prompt: <p>I'm writing some Jinja2 templates that I'd like to be able to reuse as painlessly as possible in tangentially related projects.  I have a set of custom convenience filters that I'd like the templates to "carry around" with them.  Is there a Jinja2 syntax for embedding filter definitions into a template itself?  Or a mechanism for embedding any kind of pure Python function into a Jinja2 template that can act on variables passed into the template?  I used to use mako, and there it was trivial to do this, but templating LaTeX in mako is painful because of the lack of custom syntax, so I had to make the switch.</p>
Response: There is actually a way to define custom filters within a Jinja2 template. Here's an example:
```
{% set my_filter = lambda x: x * 2 %}
{{ my_variable|my_filter }}
```
In this example, we define a lambda function that doubles its input. We then define a variable called `my_variable` and apply our custom filter to it using the pipe syntax. The result is the doubled value of `my_variable`.
You can also define more complex custom filters using Python functions. Here's an example:
```
{% set my_filter = my_function %}
{{ my_variable|my_filter }}
{% macro my_function(value) %}
    {% if value is string %}
        {{ value.upper() }}
    {% else %}
        {{ value }}
    {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
```
In this example, we define a function called `my_function` that uppercases a string input and leaves non-string inputs untouched. We then define a variable called `my_variable` and apply our custom filter to it using the pipe syntax. The result is the uppercased value of `my_variable` if it is a string or the original value if it is not.
To reuse these custom filters in other templates or projects, you can define them in a separate file and include them using the Jinja2 `import` statement.

Prompt: <p>I am trying to figure out how to get a message box to show only specific words from a text file, which contains all of the words within the dictionary. I have tried various different ways, but cannot get it to work, but I do think I am on the right track so just need some pointers.</p>
<p>Basically, there is a scrambled up string, which is different every time, and is contained within a label. I want the program to only show words which contains the letters inside the scrambled string, but not sure how to achieve this?</p>
<p>Here is the code that I have so far:</p>
<pre><code>Private Sub btnAnswers_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnAnswers.Click
    Dim hash As List(Of String) = New List(Of String)(System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("C:\Users\Katie\Documents\Project\dictionary.txt"))
    Dim Letters As String
    Dim OneCharacter As String
    Dim Found As Boolean
    Dim item As String
    Dim AllCharacters As String
    Found = False
    Letters = lblLetters.Text
    For i = 0 To Letters.Length - 1
        OneCharacter = Letters.Substring(i, 1)
        For Each item In hash
            If item.Contains(OneCharacter) Then
                Found = True
                AllCharacters = OneCharacter
            Else
                Found = False
            End If
            MsgBox(item)
        Next
    Next i
End Sub
</code></pre>
<p>The message box does show up words, from the dictionary, but words can contain letters that are not present in the label string, so my code is wrong. Can anyone help? Apologies, but I am new to programming.</p>
Response: It looks like you're on the right track. Here are some pointers to help you:
1. You're currently looping through every character in the string `Letters`, and then looping through every word in the dictionary. This can become very time-consuming if your dictionary is large. Instead, you can loop through every word in the dictionary and check if it can be formed from the letters in `Letters`.
2. You're currently setting `Found = False` at the start of each loop iteration. This means that if a word contains more than one character in `Letters`, `Found` will be reset to `False` for each character. To fix this, you can set `Found` to `True` before the inner loop, and only set it to `False` if a character in `Letters` is not found in the word.
3. You're currently setting `AllCharacters = OneCharacter` inside the inner loop. This means that `AllCharacters` will only ever contain one character. You should instead concatenate `AllCharacters` with `OneCharacter` every time a character in `Letters` is found in the word.
Here's an updated code snippet based on these pointers:
```
Private Sub btnAnswers_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnAnswers.Click
    Dim hash As List(Of String) = New List(Of String)(System.IO.File.ReadAllLines("C:\Users\Katie\Documents\Project\dictionary.txt"))
    Dim Letters As String = lblLetters.Text
    Dim Found As Boolean
    Dim item As String
    Dim AllCharacters As String = ""
    For Each item In hash
        Found = True
        For Each letter In Letters
            If Not item.Contains(letter) Then
                Found = False
                Exit For
            Else
                AllCharacters &= letter
                item = item.Remove(item.IndexOf(letter), 1)
            End If
        Next
        If Found Then
            MsgBox(item)
        End If
        AllCharacters = ""
    Next
End Sub
```
In this version of the code, we first loop through every word in the dictionary. We set `Found` to `True` before the inner loop, which now loops through every letter in `Letters`. If a character in `Letters` is not found in the word, we set `Found` to `False` and exit the inner loop. If a character is found, we concatenate it with `AllCharacters` and remove it from the word. If `Found` is still `True` after the inner loop, we display the word in a message box. We then reset `AllCharacters` for the next word.

Response: To pass the output of a bash command to an action's parameter, you can use the <code>\`command\`</code> syntax instead of <code>$(command)</code>. Here's an example:
<pre><code>- name: Create Release
  id: create_release
  uses: actions/create-release@v1
  env:

  with:
    tag_name: \`cat projectFile | grep -Po '(?&lt;=Version&gt;).*(?=&lt;/Version&gt;)' \`

Using backticks will execute the command and the output will be passed to the action's parameter.

Prompt: <p>I'm writing a simplistic HTTP server that will accept PUT requests mostly from cURL as client and I'm having a bit of an issue with handling the <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> header.</p>
<p>As I understand it, the server is supposed to read the header, send back a <code>HTTP/1.1 100 Continue</code> response on the connection, read the stream up to the value on <code>Content-Length</code> and then send back the real response code (Usually <code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK</code> but any other valid HTTP answer should do).</p>
<p>Well, that's exactly what my server does. The problem is that, apparently, if I send a <code>100 Continue</code> answer, cURL fails to report any subsequent HTTP error code and assumes the upload was a success. For instance, if the upload is rejected due to the nature of the content (there is a basic data check happening), I want the calling client to detect the problem and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Am I missing something obvious ?</p>
<p>edit: here is a sample output from cURL with a secondary header containing an error:</p>
<pre><code>&gt; PUT /test1%2Epdf HTTP/1.1
&gt; Authorization: Basic xxxx
&gt; User-Agent: curl/7.20.0 (i386-pc-win32) libcurl/7.20.0 OpenSSL/0.9.8l zlib/1.2.3
&gt; Host: localhost
&gt; Accept: */*
&gt; Content-Length: 24
&gt; Expect: 100-continue
&gt;
&lt; HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
&lt; HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
&lt; Connection: close
&lt; Content-Type: text/xml
&lt; Content-Length: 289
&lt;
</code></pre>
Response: It sounds like cURL is not properly handling the situation where the server sends back an error code after sending a <code>100 Continue</code> response. This could be a bug in cURL or a limitation in its implementation.
One workaround you could try is to send back a <code>417 Expectation Failed</code> response instead of a <code>100 Continue</code> response if the server detects an error in the content. This should cause cURL to properly report the error and not assume the upload was a success.
Alternatively, you could try disabling the <code>Expect: 100-continue</code> header on the cURL client side and handling the entire upload in a single request/response without the intermediate <code>100 Continue</code> response. This may be less efficient, but it would avoid the issue with cURL's handling of the <code>Expect</code> header.

<p><strong>When It works?</strong>

<p><strong>Possible solution</strong>:
   I think,I need to do the polling after 1 hour or something.</p>

        ]);
      })
      .then(function() {
        self.skipWaiting();
      })
  );
});
self.addEventListener('activate', function(event) {
  event.waitUntil(
    self.clients.claim()
  );
});
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request)
      .then(function(response) {
        if (response) {
          return response;
        } else {
          return fetch(event.request)
            .then(function(response) {
              return caches.open('mycache')
                .then(function(cache) {
                  cache.put(event.request, response.clone());
                  return response;
                });
            });
        }
      })
  );
});
self.addEventListener('message', function(event) {
  if (event.data && event.data.type === 'checkForUpdates') {
    self.registration.update();
  }
});</code></pre>
<p>The code above sets up a service worker that caches certain files and responds to fetch events. When a client sends a message with the type "checkForUpdates", the service worker uses the Service Worker API to update itself. You can trigger this message from your server code when a new service worker is available. This way, clients will automatically receive the new service worker without needing to refresh or wait for a polling interval.</p>

Prompt: <p>If you have a list like this:</p>
<pre><code>User1.XXXX
User2.XXXXX
User3.XXX
</code></pre>
<p>How can you create a for each loop and delete everything after the period? Also how do you delete everything before as well? I only have the basics written, and tried a few misguided attempts manipulating it with .substring etc...:</p>
<pre><code>$allUsers = Import-Csv -path "c:\Folder1\All User.csv"
$allUsers | foreach {
} | Export-Csv -Path "c:\Folder1\Removed.csv"
</code></pre>
Response: You can use the .Split() method to split each line by the period "." and then select the first element ([0]) to keep everything before the period. To delete everything after the period, you can simply concatenate a new string with only the part before the period.
Here's an example of how you can modify the code to achieve this:
<pre><code>$allUsers = Import-Csv -path "c:\Folder1\All User.csv"
$allUsers | foreach {
    $_.Username = $_.Username.Split('.')[0] # keep everything before the period
    $_ # pass the modified object down the pipeline
} | Export-Csv -Path "c:\Folder1\Removed.csv"
</code></pre>
In this example, I assumed that the column name containing the usernames is "Username". Replace this with the actual column name in your CSV file.

Prompt: <p>Here is my very first app with Django. I keep getting the error <code>"'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'"</code></p>
<p>Here is my view:</p>
<pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("&lt;h1&gt;Get most recent music for your listening pleasure&lt;/h1&gt;"),
</code></pre>
Response: The error message "'tuple' object has no attribute 'get'" typically arises when you try to access a request parameter that does not exist, or when you try to call the `get` method on a non-dict object like a tuple.
Looking at your code, you are returning a tuple `(HttpResponse("<h1>Get most recent music for your listening pleasure</h1>"),)`. The trailing comma after the response object means it will be returned as a tuple instead of a single object.
To fix this error, remove the comma at the end of the `HttpResponse` object:
```python
def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("<h1>Get most recent music for your listening pleasure</h1>")
```
This will return a single `HttpResponse` object instead of a tuple.

<p>Does anyone have any ideas about this? Why <code>vertical-align</code> doesn't work here? Thanks!</p>
Response: The <code>vertical-align</code> property only works for inline elements or table cell elements. In this case, the <code>div</code> is a block-level element, so it won't work.
One possible solution is to use absolute positioning on the <code>label</code> element. Set the position of the <code>div</code> to <code>relative</code>, and then set the position of the <code>label</code> to <code>absolute</code> and bottom to 0.
Here's an example of how the CSS would look like:
<pre><code>#contain-word {
  height: 100px;
  position: relative;
}
#contain-word-lab {
  position: absolute;
  bottom: 0;
  margin-bottom: 5px;

This should position the <code>label</code> at the bottom of the <code>div</code>.

myCell Like "Q1" Then
Range("A75").Select
ActiveWindow.ScrollRow = ActiveCell.Row
End If
Next myCell
</code></pre>
<h2>    End Sub</h2>
<p>I think the issue is with the range("A75").Select as if everything is left alone it works, but when a blank row is added above A75 the key work Q1 is no longer at the top of the spreadsheet, but is one down from where it is supposed to be.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any assistance!</p>

Response: You can modify the code to search for the keyword "Q1" only in column A and then select the cell that contains that keyword. This ensures that the code always finds the correct cell, regardless of any inserted rows.
Here's the modified code:
<pre><code>Sub Question01()
Dim myRange As Range
Dim myCell As Range
Set myRange = Range("A:A")
For Each myCell In myRange
If myCell.Value Like "Q1*" Then
myCell.Select
ActiveWindow.ScrollRow = ActiveCell.Row
Exit Sub
End If
Next myCell
End Sub
</code></pre>
This code searches for any cell in column A that starts with the letters "Q1" (using the wildcard *), and selects the first cell it finds. The "Exit Sub" line stops the loop once the keyword is found, to avoid unnecessary processing.
Hope this helps!

Prompt: <p>I am using native Wifi api on Windows to programmatically do a few tasks with WLANs. However, my problem is it exposes limited set of functions. I would like to access certain fields of a beacon frame that provides Access Point load, airtime and so on. Which are the tools that can be used to do this? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
Response: There are a few tools that you can use to access the fields of a beacon frame in Windows:
1. Wireshark: This is a popular network protocol analyzer that can capture and display the traffic on a network. You can use Wireshark to capture the traffic of the WLAN and view the beacon frames.
2. Microsoft Network Monitor: This is a network protocol analyzer from Microsoft that can capture and analyze network traffic. You can capture the WLAN traffic using this tool and view the beacon frames.
3. Npcap: This is a Windows packet capturing library that you can use to capture and analyze network traffic. Npcap works with Wireshark and other packet capturing tools.
Once you have captured the beacon frames using one of these tools, you can extract the information that you need from the frame. The information is usually contained in the Information Elements (IEs) of the frame. The IEs are variable-length fields that contain information about the WLAN, such as the SSID, the security settings, and the capabilities of the access point. You can use a tool like Wireshark to view the IEs and extract the information that you need.

Prompt: <p>I am using </p>
<p><code>$rootScope.$broadcast("closeviewMultiUserMainDetail");</code></p>
<p>and using in by below</p>
<pre><code>$rootScope.$on("closeviewMultiUserMainDetail", function (event) {
            //other code
        });
</code></pre>
<p>sometimes ‍‍<code>$rootScope.$on</code> Called several times.</p>
<p>How can this be prevented?</p>
Response: One way to prevent multiple calls to `$rootScope.$on` is to unregister the listener using the `off` method when it is no longer needed. For example, you can modify your code like this:
<pre><code>function onCloseviewMultiUserMainDetail() {
  // other code
}
$rootScope.$on("closeviewMultiUserMainDetail", onCloseviewMultiUserMainDetail);
// to "turn off" the listener
$scope.$on('$destroy', function() {
  $rootScope.off("closeviewMultiUserMainDetail", onCloseviewMultiUserMainDetail);
});
</code></pre>
In this example, the `onCloseviewMultiUserMainDetail` function is assigned to the listener and then passed as the second argument to `$rootScope.$on`. When the scope is destroyed (e.g. when the controller is unloaded), the `off` method is called to remove the listener. This ensures that the listener is only called once and does not continue to listen for subsequent events.

Prompt: <p>My IS is running on EC2 and sending slo to <code>https://ec2-52-XXXXX.amazonaws.com:9443/samlsso?slo=true</code> after logout the page redirects to <code>localhost:9443/authenticationendpoint/samlsso_logout.do</code> . I was expecting it should be <code>https://&lt;IS_Server&gt;:9443/authenticationendpoint/samlsso_logo‌​ut.do</code> . Any idea what I am missing?  How/Where to specify and change the urls?</p>
Response: It seems like the logout URL is hardcoded to redirect to "localhost" instead of the IS server hostname. To change this behavior, you may need to update the SAML SSO configuration in your IS instance.
Here are the steps to update the logout URL:
1. Log in to your IS management console.
2. Go to "Service Providers" and select the relevant service provider for which you want to update the SAML SSO configuration.
3. Click "Inbound Authentication Configuration" and select "SAML2 Web SSO Configuration".
4. In the "Logout Response" section, update the "Response URL" field to use the hostname of your IS server instead of "localhost".
5. Save the configuration changes.
After making these changes, your IS instance should redirect to the correct logout URL.

Prompt: <p>I have a list of SpatialPolygons I created using lapply and the <code>raster::buffer</code> function. I would like to convert the files in the list back to a list of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame objects. I tried the answer provided here (although note my issue is slightly different because I would like to end up with a LIST of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame objects): <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46890221/r-spatialpolygonsdataframe-from-a-list-of-spatialpolygons">R - SpatialPolygonsDataFrame from a list of SpatialPolygons</a>, but i don't know how to get unique IDs for each object in the list. When I apply that code, I get the following error msg:</p>
<pre><code>#Getting polygon IDs
IDs &lt;- sapply(list_of_SPols, function(x)
 slot(slot(x, "polygons")[[1]], "ID"))
#Checking
length(unique(IDs)) == length(list_of_SPols) #output = [1] FALSE
#Making SpatialPolygons from list of polygons
Spol &lt;- SpatialPolygons(lapply(list_of_SPols,
                            function(x) slot(x, "polygons")[[1]]))
#output = Error in validObject(res) :
  #invalid class “SpatialPolygons” object: non-unique Polygons ID slot
  #values
</code></pre>
<p>My SpatialPolygons list elements have unique index values, but when I check the output of the IDs object created above, a subset of it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[1] "1" "1" "1" "1" "1" "1" "1"....
</code></pre>
<p>So all list elements have the same IDs. So I think what I need to do is create unique IDs equal to the index numbers? </p>
<p>How do I do this, then how do I go on to create a list of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame objects?</p>
Response: One way to create unique IDs for each element in the list of SpatialPolygons is to use the list index as the ID value. This can be done using the `seq_along()` function to generate a sequence of numbers equal to the length of the list, and then converting those numbers to character strings to use as the ID values:
```
IDs <- as.character(seq_along(list_of_SPols))
```
This will create a vector of ID values that correspond to the index position of each element in the list.
To convert the list of SpatialPolygons to a list of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame objects, you can use `lapply()` to iterate over the list and add the ID values as a new attribute to each SpatialPolygons object. This can be done using the `spChFIDs()` function, which takes a SpatialPolygons object and a vector of ID values as inputs:
```
list_of_SPDFs <- lapply(list_of_SPols, function(x) {
  spChFIDs(x, as.character(seq_along(list_of_SPols)))
  as(x, "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame")
})
```
This code will create a new list of SpatialPolygonsDataFrame objects, where each object has a unique ID value corresponding to its position in the list.

Response: <p>The error message indicates that there are unresolved external symbols related to Phonon library. To fix this, you need to make sure the Phonon library is properly linked to your project.</p>
<p>Since you are using CMake, you can add the following lines to your CMakeLists.txt file to link the Phonon library:</p>
<pre><code>find_package(Phonon REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(yourProjectName ${QT_LIBS} ${PHONON_LIBRARIES})
</code></pre>
<p>If the above code doesn't work, you can try to manually link the Phonon library to your project. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open your project properties in Visual Studio</li>
<li>Go to Configuration Properties &gt; Linker &gt; Input</li>
<li>Add "phonon.lib" to Additional Dependencies</li>
</ol>
<p>After making these changes, rebuild your project and the error should be resolved.</p>

Response: You can remove the lines of code related to GPU and replace them with the `torch.device("cpu")`. This will make the model run on CPU instead of GPU.
The updated `train_model` function would look like this:
```
def train_model(model, train_loader, val_loader, epoch, loss_function, optimizer, path, early_stop):
    # CPU
    device = torch.device("cpu")
    model = model.to(device)
    patience, eval_loss = 0, 0
    # train
    for i in range(epoch):
        total_loss, count = 0, 0
        y_pred = list()
        y_true = list()
        for idx, (x, y) in tqdm(enumerate(train_loader), total=len(train_loader)):
            x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)
            u, m = model(x)
            predict = torch.sigmoid(torch.sum(u*m, 1))
            y_pred.extend(predict.cpu().detach().numpy())
            y_true.extend(y.cpu().detach().numpy())
            loss = loss_function(predict, y.float())
            optimizer.zero_grad()
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
            total_loss += float(loss)
            count += 1
        train_auc = roc_auc_score(np.array(y_true), np.array(y_pred))
        torch.save(model, path.format(i+1))
        print("Epoch %d train loss is %.3f and train auc is %.3f" % (i+1, total_loss / count, train_auc))
        # verify
        total_eval_loss = 0
        model.eval()
        count_eval = 0
        val_y_pred = list()
        val_true = list()
        for idx, (x, y) in tqdm(enumerate(val_loader), total=len(val_loader)):
            x, y = x.to(device), y.to(device)
            u, m = model(x)
            predict = torch.sigmoid(torch.sum(u*m, 1))
            val_y_pred.extend(predict.cpu().detach().numpy())
            val_true.extend(y.cpu().detach().numpy())
            loss = loss_function(predict, y.float())
            total_eval_loss += float(loss)
            count_eval += 1
        val_auc = roc_auc_score(np.array(y_true), np.array(y_pred))
        print("Epoch %d val loss is %.3fand train auc is %.3f" % (i+1, total_eval_loss / count_eval, val_auc))
```
Note: Running the model on CPU may result in longer training times compared to GPU.
