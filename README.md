## Overview
Gaia is a comprehensive **User Task Management System** designed to optimize and manage tasks effectively. The system integrates an advanced virtual assistant powered by **Large Language Models (LLM)** and **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** to provide an intelligent, responsive, and personalized task management experience for users.

## Key Features
### **Core Features**
1. **Virtual AI Assistant**: The system leverages state-of-the-art LLM models to understand user queries, provide insights, and offer seamless task-related assistance in both text and voice formats.
2. **Task Management**: Gaia helps users create, manage, and optimize their tasks efficiently with automation and scheduling capabilities.
3. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Enhances user input processing by extracting meaningful entities like names, dates, locations, and task-specific details.
4. **Work Optimization**: Automates task prioritization and schedule planning to ensure maximum productivity.
5. **Integration & Notifications**: Gaia seamlessly integrates with user calendars, sends timely notifications, and helps manage deadlines.
6. **Logging and Tracking**: Comprehensive logging and tracking ensure transparency and allow users to monitor their tasks and progress.

### **Future Enhancements**
1. **Automatic Task Recognition**: Gaia will automatically identify tasks users need to perform through natural conversations, even when users do not explicitly state their requirements.
2. **Interactive Recommendations**: Gaia will proactively recommend tasks, reminders, and actions to users through notifications and real-time conversations.
3. **Enhanced Chatbot Integrations**: Expanded functionalities to seamlessly integrate the chatbot with other systems, enabling smoother workflows and enhanced productivity.

## How Gaia Works
Gaia operates as an interconnected microservices system, combining AI-powered insights with effective task management workflows:
1. **User Interaction**: Users interact with Gaia via System CLI or Client GUI.
2. **Input Processing**: The AI assistant processes user queries using LLM and NER models to understand intent and extract key entities.
3. **Task Management**: The backend services manage tasks, schedules, and workflows, providing optimized solutions.
4. **Notifications & Recommendations**: Gaia ensures users receive timely updates, actionable suggestions, and reminders to boost productivity.
5. **Work Optimization**: Gaia prioritizes and organizes tasks for optimal productivity based on user data and preferences.
6. **Logging**: All actions and system activities are logged for monitoring and auditing.

## System Architecture
The Gaia system is built as a collection of interconnected microservices:
- **Gaia - System CLI**: Allows users to interact with Gaia directly through a local console using text or voice commands.
- **Gaia Connector**: A service enabling Gaia to interact with backend systems.
- **Client GUI**: A user-friendly web interface for task management.
- **Middleware Loader**: A public-facing service that bridges the Client GUI with the backend systems.
- **Authentication Service**: Manages user authorization and authentication securely.
- **Personal Task Manager**: Core service responsible for task creation, updates, and management.
- **Schedule Plan**: Handles calendar integrations and automated scheduling.
- **Work Optimization**: Optimizes tasks and schedules based on user priorities.
- **Notify Agent**: Sends timely notifications and reminders for tasks.
- **Logging Tracker**: Manages logs and ensures the system's backend processes are transparent and auditable.
